tc.research_category.THAUMIC_AUGMENTATION=Thaumic Augmentation
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumic_augmentation_base.title=Thaumic Augmentation
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumic_augmentation_base.0=I'll dedicate this section of the Thaumonomicon to any miscellaneous discoveries I make. Who knows what I may come up with?

thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_thaumium.title=Thaumium Caster's Gauntlet
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_thaumium.0=As I noted before, iron is a very poor vis conductor. It gets the job done, but now that I have discovered thaumium, it should be a simple task to upgrade my old caster's gauntlet prototype to be much more effective than before.<BR>While I am making modifications, I might as well investigate enchanted fabric's usefulness as a replacement for leather.
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_thaumium.1=I have successfully created the new casting gauntlet, which I am (uncreatively) calling the Thaumium Caster's Gauntlet. The introduction of Thaumium allows the caster to be more about 10% more efficient with the usage of Vis, in addition to slightly reducing the cooldown between casts.<BR>It seems that the enchanted fabric takes very well to dyes - I only need to combine the gauntlet with one or more dyes on a mundane crafting table to get a new color. To remove the dye, I need to use the gauntlet on a filled, mundane cauldron.

thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_void.title=Voidseer Caster's Gauntlet
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_void.0=While the thaumium casting gauntlet was certainly a success, I can't help but wonder if void metal is as effective a vis conductor as thaumium is. Even if it isn't, I have trouble believing its morphic properties won't have some benefit. 
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_void.1=My results so far have been surprisingly disappointing. I have seen a small reduction in the vis cost of casting, but not enough to outweigh thaumium's faster recharge abilities.<BR>Perhaps I have been looking at the wrong component to improve...
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_void.2=It seems my previous conjecture has proven to be correct. Upon replacing the vis resonator with a voidseer's pearl, the gauntlet felt much more connected to the surronding aura. So connected, in fact, that not only have I measured a 30% vis discount over my original prototype, but it also absorbs vis over a much wider area. Hopefully this will mean I can cast with very complex foci without depleting the local aura nearly as quickly as before.<BR>It seems that while the cooldown time of this gauntlet is still better than the original caster, the thaumium gauntlet is still superior in this regard. I will have to decide which trait, vis usage or cooldown time, I find more valuable. Luckilly, the ability to dye the gauntlet was retained from its predecessor. The method to apply and remove dye is the same as for the thaumium gauntlet.

thaumicaugmentation.research.vis_regenerator.title=Vis Regenerator
thaumicaugmentation.research.vis_regenerator.0=As I have come to experience, a session of advanced arcane crafting or foci casting can leave the aura completely depleted. I should try to find something that can help regenerate the aura a bit quicker than letting it recover naturally.
thaumicaugmentation.research.vis_regenerator.1=I have drawn up plans for a device I am calling the Vis Regenerator. It consists of a lattice layer, made of silverwood leaves and an essentia filter, with an outer casing that attempts to "recirculate" the aura through the lattice.<BR>An interesting characteristic of this device is that the effectiveness seems to be tied to the total capacity of the local aura. In other words, areas that naturally have a low amount of vis will experience a higher rate of regeneration.<BR>If I need to disable the Vis Regenerator for any reason, applying a redstone signal should do the job.
thaumicaugmentation.research.vis_regenerator.2=Because of the Vis Regenerator's delicate relationship with the local aura, I should avoid using it in areas with a lot of flux. I have a feeling it would the make aura pollution much worse...

thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_copier.title=Seal Copier
thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_copier.0=Configuring golem seals by hand is fine for small projects, but when stacks of seals get involved it becomes tedious and error-prone. I should research a way to quickly configure large amounts of seals.
thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_copier.1=I have created plans for a basic seal copying device. I just need to configure one seal with the settings I need, then right click it with the copier. I then only need to right click every other seal I want to apply the settings to. If I want to clear the memory of the copier, I need to right click while sneaking. I can then copy new settings and continue.<BR>It seems that the seal copier is unable to interact with seals that were not placed by the owner. I should keep this in mind if I am working with other Thaumaturges.

thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_secure.title=Control Seal: Secure
thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_secure.0=Though I have already created a seal that will make golems protect a specific area, I feel this does not cover the entirety of what may be possible with combat golems. In fact, it should be trivial to apply the principle that the guard seal uses for small areas, but to instead incite golems to attack any monsters that they can see.
thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_secure.1=After a very simple modification, the guard seal has become the secure seal. This control seal will incite any appropriate combat capable golems to attack any threat that they can see in their operating range, as opposed to threats in a small area. Unlike most other seals, the secure seal does not have a configurable area - instead, the seal will make nearby golems attack intruding creatures within the fixed (but much larger) range of the seal. However, this means I should take extra care to ensure that golems do not attack anything they’re not supposed to, as the outcome of such a mishap would be very disappointing.
thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_secure.2=I am now able to create an advanced version of this seal. This advanced version will allow me to have better control of what combat golems with biothaumic minds will attack, and if they should only care about targets that are within their line of sight.

thaumicaugmentation.research.more_auromancy.title=Further Auromancy Studies
thaumicaugmentation.research.more_auromancy.0=I have already discovered quite a few elemental foci effects, but I feel there is still much more to discover. There are so many aspects of essentia I have not experimented with that I am bound to find something useful.

thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_light.title=Focus Effect: Light
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_light.0=While fire does give off light, it can be a bit... destructive. It should be somewhat simple to create an effect completely dedicated to giving off light. To begin, I should examine some light sources I already have access to.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_light.1=The light pattern does exactly what I was hoping - it creates a bright light source wherever it is used. The light source will even be able to last forever - meaning I can use it for permanent lighting if I wish.<BR>I do wonder what would happen if a living creature was exposed to this pattern's blast of light.

thaumicaugmentation.research.warded_arcana.title=Warded Arcana
thaumicaugmentation.research.warded_arcana.0=While browsing some of the old manuscripts in the Thaumonomicon, I came across a section that described the applications of warding arcana. Being able to create objects that are protected against everything except its owner sounds like something I should investigate. I should begin my studies by examining the warded device I have already created, the Warded Jar.
thaumicaugmentation.research.warded_arcana.1=My examination of the Warded Jar provided me with all I need to know - it should be possible to apply protective properties to almost all materials, so long as I apply a special rune to the object first. While I'm excited by the possibilities this can lead to, I think it would be best to start with something simple - like a chest.
thaumicaugmentation.research.warded_arcana.2=By taking a mundane chest and applying a warding sigil, I have created a container that is not only almost invoidable to all outside forces, but is also only accessible to me. This means I cannot use neither traditional methods of extracting and inserting items, such as hoppers, nor golems - maybe this is something I can look into in the future.<BR>Should I want to remove the chest, I need to sneak and then use any casting gauntlet on it.

thaumicaugmentation.research.arcane_door.title=Arcane Door
thaumicaugmentation.research.arcane_door.0=Now that I have mastered the basics of warding objects, I think I can move on to something a bit more advanced. The original manuscripts I read described an indestructable door, which sounds like something worth researching. After all, replacing doors broken down by zombies does get annoying after a while...
thaumicaugmentation.research.arcane_door.1=I have managed to create the warded door described in the manuscript, which I am calling the Arcane Door. Just like the Warded Chest, the doors will only open for their owner, and are extremely difficult to remove by normal means. I have also made three different styles - greatwood, silverwood, and thaumium. They are all functionally the same, but it is nice to have options for decoration purposes.<BR>If I want to remove the door, I need to sneak and then use the bottom half of it with any casting gauntlet.<BR>It seems that these doors are "smart" in the sense that two doors placed next to each other act as double doors and will open and close together. How convenient.<BR>I have also created trapdoor forms of these doors. They work in the same way as the normal doors, just in a smaller profile.

thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_keys.title=Access Control
thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_keys.0=Being able to have private objects is nice and all, but sometimes I need to share my belongings with fellow Thaumaturges. I should devise a way to selectively grant access to those I want to permit.
thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_keys.1=I have created objects to allow others to access arbitrary warded objects - keys. But these are not any ordinary keys, as they will learn to emulate the person they are bound to. This seems sufficient to bypass the protections of the wards, provided the bound person matches with the object. Each key works slightly differently - I have written instructions for each type of key on the following pages, should I need to reference them.<PAGE>Iron Key<DIV><IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/items/key_iron.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG>These are the simplest of the three types of keys. To bind one to my warded objects, I need to use it on empty space (it does not need to be used on any block). It will then allow anyone possessing the key access. To unbind the key, I should use the key while sneaking.<PAGE>Brass Key<DIV><IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/items/key_brass.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG>This key functions in a similar way to the iron key - use to bind, sneak while using to unbind. However, the brass key has the ability to copy its binding to an iron key. To do this, one needs to place both the brass key and an unbound iron key in a mundane crafting grid. The brass key will not be consumed by this process. Copying thaumium keys will be described in the following section. <PAGE>Thaumium Key<DIV><IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/items/key_thaumium.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG>The thaumium key is interesting in that it does not only bind to beings - it also binds to the object and its location. In other words, this key will permit to access to a single warded object at a location. To bind this key, I need to use it on the warded object I want to bind it to. This binding will still be valid even if I remove and replace the object at a location, but only if it still matches the type of object the key was originally bound to. Sneaking while using the key will unbind it, like the others. To copy a Thaumium key, I need to combine it in a mundane crafting grid with an empty Thaumium key and a brass key bound to the same person as the thaumium key.

thaumicaugmentation.research.boots_void.title=Boots of the Riftstrider
thaumicaugmentation.research.boots_void.0=With void metal allowing me to upgrade most of my existing armor to take advantage of its superior capabilities, it only makes sense for me to try to apply this material to the Boots of the Traveller as well.
thaumicaugmentation.research.boots_void.1=I have succeeded in upgrading the Boots of the Traveller into a superior form I am calling the Boots of the Riftstrider. These boots have the expected boosts to speed and jump height over the original (at the cost of slightly increased vis consumption), as well as the auto-repair capabilities of all void metal items. Most notably, fall damage is greatly reduced beyond the jump height of these boots - I can practically fall into a ravine and walk away unharmed.<BR>These boots are also now dyeable. I simply need to craft them with the dye(s) I want to color them, or use them on a filled, mundane cauldron to wash away the dye.

thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_studies.title=Rift Studies
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_studies.0=I think that flux rifts are much more important to my studies than they may seem. When they are created from an excess of flux, they open and connect to the void. I'm sure that they contain the secret to opening rifts into places that are more... hospitable.<BR>However, studying flux rifts currently requires me to saturate the aura with flux. It might be beneficial to contain all the flux I need into a small "seed" that can then be released into the target area, rather than having to resort to more messy alternatives. I should look into ways to compress a large amount of flux into a small space.
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_studies.1=By concentrating a large amount of Vitium essentia into a void seed, the flux created will shortly be absorbed into the aura and almost certaintly create a rift. I should be very careful with these flux seeds - "planting" them will instantly release all of its contained flux, consuming the seed.<BR>It seems that limiting the essentia in the seed to strictly Vitium allows more flux to be created per unit of essentia than just dumping it into the aura. If I want to take advantage of this to create larger rifts, I should be able to infuse even more Vitium into the smaller flux seed. However, not only does the instability in the infusion increase with the amount of Vitium added, but I only seem to be able to safely use this process once on any given flux seed.

thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_augmentation.title=Augmentation
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_augmentation.0=While creating improved casting gauntlets like the Thaumium gauntlet is great and all, at some point I will be unable to come up with designs for new gauntlets. Maybe I should spend some time thinking of ways to improve the designs I already have. This also presents me with an opportunity to come up with a system that is modular enough to not require constantly replacing gauntlets as I make new advancements in my research.
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_augmentation.1=I have come up with some initial plans for a system to make casting foci more effective. The first component required is a sort of "modifier" that creates additional energy for use by the caster. However, I will need some sort of filter to actually make use of this extra energy - which I think I can create in a similar way to foci. Because these are additions to the existing mechanisms of the gauntlet, I believe I will call this new type of device an "augment".<BR>While I want to be able to apply a wide variety of "modifiers" as the providers of energy to these effect crystals, I should start with something simple. The casting gauntlets I have created thus far all use a Vis Resonator to interface with the aura. Perhaps I can create a type of resonator that is specialized towards a specific aspect of essentia, instead of the entire spectrum of them.<BR>This new elemental resonator modifier should allow the gauntlet to more efficiently use a single aspect of essentia, allowing any focus effects with the same aspect to become more effective. Depending on the focusing crystal I decide to use, one of three traits can be affected - focus power, casting speed, or Vis efficiency. However, due to the way it "magnifies" the aspect, this process is only possible for a single aspect per gauntlet. Still, I'm excited to build a modular augment and see just how effective this new augment system I have devised is in practice.<BR>To actually build this augment, I will need to craft an Elemental Modifier (which acts as the modifier) and combine it with any effect crystal in a crafting grid. Sadly, once they are combined, it is not possible to separate them again. While the plans I have drawn up use an Ordo crystal and power effect crystal as an example, I should be able to use any combination of Vis crystal and effect crystal, depending on which Aspect and trait I want to make more powerful.
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_augmentation.2=Just as I thought, I have been able to create the final resonator without issue. One unforseen problem I have discovered with casting, however, is that while a single aspect reacts favorably, one or more other aspects will react negatively to the presence of the resonator. Which aspects they are seems to vary for each aspect. I should experiment with aspects I plan on using to ensure that the foci I wish to use aren't negatively affected.<BR>I can place the Elemental Modifier (or any completed augment with it as the modifier) with any vis crystal in a crafting grid to swap out the internal crystal. I will be able to get the old crystal back as well.<BR>As for the augment system itself, I have designed it to be fairly modular. As I have done before, each augment is made up of a modifier (like the Elemental Modifier) and an effect (one of the three focusing crystals: focus power, casting speed, and Vis cost), combined together in a mundane crafting grid. To apply an augment to a device, I only need to place it with the item (primarily my casting gauntlets so far) to augment in any crafting grid. While it looks like these casting gauntlets should be able to support at least 3 augments without issue, combining multiple augments with the same type of modifier (including Elemental Modifiers with different Aspects) does not seem to be possible. If I need to remove an augment for some reason, placing the gauntlet alone in a crafting grid will remove the most recently added augment. It is possible to add and remove augments an unlimited number of times.<BR>Sadly, I have been unable to get the original Caster's Gauntlet to support my augmentation system. The poor materials used in the gauntlet seem to be unable to handle the additional stress added to it by the augments. Oh well, it was just a prototype anyway.

thaumicaugmentation.research.dimensional_modifiers.title=Dimensional Modifiers
thaumicaugmentation.research.dimensional_modifiers.0=While the Elemental Modifier was able to increase the effectiveness of casting by reacting to the focus' aspect, an internal stimuli, I should be able to make modifiers that react to external stimuli as well. The simplest of these would be the mundane materials that make up the dimensions I can visit. I should study some samples of materials from each of these places to find out if I can use them for this purpose, and find a way to make the augment improve focus casting whilst I am in the dimensions which these materials originate from.
thaumicaugmentation.research.dimensional_modifiers.1=I have created three different dimensional modifiers, each one reacting positively from being in the Overworld, the Nether, or the End, respectively. The modifier itself works by using a crystalline structure that resonates when it is brought into the dimension it is linked to, with this linking process being achieved by using resources that come from a certain dimension to create the crystal. While all of these dimensional modifiers will give a benefit, it seems like the modifier for the Nether is stronger than the Overworld's modifier, and the End's modifier is stronger than both. I'm not quite sure why this is the case, especially considering how the latter dimensions generally have lower Vis levels than the Overworld, but I may be able to discover this with further research in the future. Something else may very well be at play here.

thaumicaugmentation.research.emptiness_modifier.title=Modifier: Emptiness
thaumicaugmentation.research.emptiness_modifier.0=Now that I have visited the Emptiness, I should be able to create a dimensional modifier that makes focus casting more powerful there, in the same manner as I did for the three comparatively mundane dimensions I have created modifiers for so far.
thaumicaugmentation.research.emptiness_modifier.1=With my experience from creating the previous dimensional modifiers, making one for the Emptiness was an easy task. I simply needed to apply the previous principles of dimensional modifier creation, but instead using Emptiness-specific resources for my research and the inevitable augment modifier creation. This modifier also appears to be as powerful as the End's modifier, so that is a pleasant surprise. I do find it an odd coincidence that the most powerful dimensional modifiers are related to dimensions that are more akin to void worlds, with both the End and the Emptiness being mostly barren floating islands in a starry void. In fact, it may not be a coincidence at all. I fear that the eldritch energies in these dimensions (visible in the quantities of Alienis, Vacuos, and Tenebrae in the materials of these worlds) may be having an effect on the aura. I am unsure of the long-term consequences this may have, but it is almost certainly something I will have to monitor in the future.

thaumicaugmentation.research.frenzy_modifier.title=Modifier: Frenzy
thaumicaugmentation.research.frenzy_modifier.0=Most of my efforts in researching and experimenting with augment modifiers have been focused on passive effects. It may be prudent to try to come up with a system to actively increase my casting abilities while I am using it.<BR>Normally, the flow of Vis through the gauntlet must be regulated to a slow rate, or the device will simply not work. If I am using this Vis frequently enough, it should be possible to slowly increase this limit whilst using the gauntlet. The main problem with this is that precisely monitoring such small differences in Vis usage is not the easiest thing to do, especially with the equipment available to me. But what if there was another way to indirectly measure my Vis usage?<BR>I have considered one way to possibly make this work - during my recent studies in Golemancy, I have created the aggression module, which incites golems to attack other creatures. If I can somehow measure a reaction in the module when damaging something through focus casting, I might be able to use it as a signal to speed up the flow of Vis throughout the gauntlet. I should give my theory a try, but I doubt this will work like I am hoping it will.
thaumicaugmentation.research.frenzy_modifier.1=Surprisingly, my idea to make the aggression module regulate the flow of Vis was a success. The aggression module, with some minor adjustments, is able to detect damage done to creatures through focus casting, and will output a measurable signal accordingly. The Frenzy module, as I have come to call it, will thus gradually improve the flow of Vis through the gauntlet and its connected focus. To put it simply, if I continue to deal damage to a monster or any other creature within a relatively short time frame, my casting will gradually become more and more powerful. If I holster my caster or don't damage anything for a period of time, the flow of Vis will immediately reset to its natural level.

thaumicaugmentation.research.experience_modifier.title=Modifier: Experience
thaumicaugmentation.research.experience_modifier.0=While I had made use of the knowledge buried inside experience orbs in devices such as the Headband of Curiosity, I feel I may be able to make use of the knowledge contained within these orbs to better focus the magical energies involved in spell casting. Knowledge is inherently related to Auromancy, as a wiser Thaumaturge is better able to manipulate the Aura, since they have a better understanding of its flow and of the ways to manipulate it to their advantage. Through application of experience levels I may yet find another means of improving my spell casting abilities.
thaumicaugmentation.research.experience_modifier.1=Knowledge of the Aura gained through research naturally improves one’s ability to use it. So it is only logical that the experience gained through simply living one’s life, whether from ordinary activities or more esoteric ones, can also enhance one’s Auromancy abilities. In this case, I have managed to create an augment modifier that improves the flow of Vis based on how many experience levels I have gained. I should be able to see a benefit even with low amounts of experience, albeit a small one. It will take me quite a lot of experience to fully utilize this modifier's capabilities - I do suppose that wisdom does not lend itself easily to the inexperienced.

thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone.title=Void Stone
thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone.0=<IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/blocks/void_stone.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG><BR>This dark-colored stone can be found in most locales around dimensional fractures. It easily binds to other pieces of itself, meaning it is able to be put back together after being broken. It is also noticeably softer than normal stone.
thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone.1=<IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/blocks/void_stone_soil_taint_side_0.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG><BR>This layer of taint appears on the surface of tainted areas in the Emptiness. Although it still sticks together relatively easily, it seems to be infused with some kind of ancient biological material - similar to the tainted things I have enountered before. Unlike "normal" tainted blocks, it is very stable and will not spread or decay over time.
thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone.2=<IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/blocks/void_stone_taint.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG><BR>This variant of Void Stone is found in the tainted lands of the Emptiness. Just like its soil counterpart, it will not decay or spread to nearby materials.

thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone_usage.title=Manufacturing Eldritch Stone
thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone_usage.0=One thing I haven't managed to confirm yet was the mention of a special type of stone in the Crimson Rites - one that was extremely durable and had magical properties that resemble those of Arcane Stone. Although it is lacking in details on its creation, it does mention combining a purple stone with eldritch energy. This purple stone sounds eerily similar to the Void Stone I recently discovered - I need to investigate this for myself.
thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone_usage.1=For better or for worse, the Crimson Cult was right once again. I was able to transform a small piece of Void Stone into the stone described, which I will call Eldritch Stone. Just as the Rites described, this stone is able to withstand almost any explosion, and takes longer than usual to remove with pickaxes and other tools.

thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_power.title=Rift Power
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_power.0=Drawing power from rifts to make void seeds is useful in itself, but I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of the potential of rift energy. However, before I can find uses for this energy, I need to find a way to extract it into a usable form. 
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_power.1=Thanks to some research, I have determined that it should be possible to hold energy from rifts in a custom storage cell. This cell will need to have a heavilly modified void seed core, which acts as the receptor for the energy.<BR>I suppose I should give this energy a name. Because rift energy seems to be much more volatile than the Vis I've worked with before, I think a suitable name would be "Impetus" - force.<BR>Now all I need is a tool to extract the energy with. Instead of making a dedicated tool for this purpose, I'm confident that I can use my augment system to attach some sort of energy extractor to a casting gauntlet.
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_power.2=I have finally finished creating all I need to begin delving into the uses of Impetus. Not only can the device I created extract power from a rift, it is also capable of releasing it somewhat rapidly. To get started, I should attach the Impetus Conductor to a gauntlet. Then, I only need to stand close to a flux rift and it will slowly drain energy from the rift into the augment.<BR>As with the Void Siphon, drawing energy from the rift will cause it become more unstable, in addition to rapidly shrinking - eventually into nothing. If I don't want to constantly make new flux rifts, I should ensure the rift stays stable and has a healthy size.<BR>While I don't have any other devices that make use of Impetus at the moment, I have noticed a peculiar effect on the casting gauntlet itself. The presence of Impetus seems to slightly increase the power of any focus, without consuming any Impetus to do so. This seems to continue for as long as the attached Impetus Conductor contains at least some energy - the amount does not seem to matter.

research.f_STRONGPICKAXE.text=Any powerful mining tool

thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_coremod.title=Focus Effect: Ward
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_coremod.0=Now that I have successfully warded individual objects, I think I should look into applying warding thaumaturgy to arbitrary materials in the world. While I doubt that any given material will be able to match the strength of dedicated warded blocks, any extra protection is worth investigating. I should experiment with some common means of destruction to get an idea of how far I can go with this.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_coremod.1=Surprisingly, my experiments went better than I expected - I have created a focus effect capable of warding any simple material placed in the world. "Simple materials" includes objects like stone and dirt that are inert and exhibit no special properties. Sadly, machines are rendered frozen in time by the ward focus, meaning that objects like redstone mechanisms will not work properly while warded. More complex machines will fail to be warded at all.<BR>While I have done my best to protect against as many different methods of destruction as I could, I know I cannot protect against them all. Despite this, I am certain that warded blocks should be immune to manual breaking, normal explosions, fire damage, piston movement and even the effect of gravity on blocks such as gravel or sand.<BR>There are multiple ways to tell if something is warded using this focus effect - the easiest is to punch it. If energy seems to ripple from the impact, then it is surely warded. Holding any casting gauntlet with a warding focus equipped will allow me to directly observe the warding energies around blocks, giving them a shimmering effect in a small area around where I am looking. The color of this shimmering effect seems to be related to the caster - the particles will be green if I was the caster, but red if it was not me.<BR>To remove the ward on a block, I just need to recast the ward focus on it. In the event that a block is somehow destroyed even while warded, the protection of the ward will fade from that location.<BR>Lastly, I should be careful with what I choose to ward. While experimenting with different objects can be fun, I'm still dealing with an uncharted area of thaumaturgy. I can't be sure that every block will still work perfectly.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_coremod.2=Golems seem to ignore the presence of warded objects when going about their business. If I find that my golems are wandering aimlessly instead of doing their tasks, I should ensure that the blocks they are supposed to interact with are not warded.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_coremod.3=The Arcane Bore seems to be intelligent enough to ignore warded blocks and instead mine whatever it can. However, warded blocks will prevent it from mining any blocks behind them. I should ensure the mining area is clear of warded blocks if I wish to use the Arcane Bore.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_coremod.4=The rift focus effect should fail to work on any warded blocks. This means I should be able to deny access to an area, even if there are other Thaumaturges around who have discovered such dimensional magic.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_coremod.5=I have ensured that the exchange focus effect should not work on warded blocks. Any attempt to exchange a warded block for another will fail entirely, much like when trying to exchange any other kind of indestructible block. Thus, even if there are other practitioners of Thaumaturgy in the area, my warded areas should remain safe and secure.

thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_no_coremod.title=Focus Effect: Ward
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_no_coremod.0=Now that I have successfully warded individual objects, I think I should look into applying warding thaumaturgy to arbitrary materials in the world. While I doubt that any given material will be able to match the strength of dedicated warded blocks, any extra protection is worth investigating.

If I find that my golems are wandering aimlessly instead of doing their tasks, I should ensure that the blocks they are supposed to interact with are not warded.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_no_coremod.3=It appears that the Arcane Bore's one-track clockwork mind is quite confused by the idea of warded blocks. If the next block it would mine is warded, the bore will unsuccessfully attempt to mine it forever. I should ensure the mining area is clear of warded blocks if I wish to use the Arcane Bore.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_no_coremod.4=As the rift focus effect just moves blocks somewhere else, and doesn't otherwise damage them, those rifts will be able to be created on warded blocks. I should keep this in mind if I am trying to deny access to an area and there are other Thaumaturges around.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_no_coremod.5=As the exchange focus effect simply replaces one type of block for another by swapping their position, warded blocks can still be exchanged. However, the ward should at least remain on the exchanged blocks, but I should still take care if there are other practitioners of Thaumaturgy in the area.

thaumicaugmentation.research.fracture_theory.title=Discovering the Emptiness
thaumicaugmentation.research.fracture_theory.0=I have been trying to determine if it would be possible to open a Flux Rift that doesn't lead to a swift death for quite a while now. While I think it isn't possible for me to open one myself, I have a theory that some may exist naturally in the world. However, these fractures in the fabric of reality can only occur in certain locations, where the boundries between dimensions are weaker than normal. I should create a device that can help me locate one of these places.
thaumicaugmentation.research.fracture_theory.1=I have drawn up plans for a device that should be able to point me towards a dimensional fracture. By attuning a vacuous crystal with some rare earths, the crystal will react strongly to an excess of its own aspect - which just so happens to be that of the void. I also need to use a mundane material like brass for the outer casing, as using thaumium or void metal will probably make it too sensitive to get an accurate reading.<BR>Once crafted, the crystal in the device will glow if I am facing towards a fracture. The stronger the glow, the closer to the exact direction I am facing. Sadly, it appears that the Fracture Locator has a limited range. I don't have any precise measurements of exactly how far that may be, but some quick testing shows that its ability to trace the presence of vacuous drops sharply rougly at the distance where the ground meets the horizon.<BR>My calculations seem to show that space is greatly compressed in whatever place these fractures lead to, in a similar way to the Nether. Perhaps I should check there if I am having any trouble finding a fracture.

thaumicaugmentation.research.entering_fracture.title=Entering the Emptiness
thaumicaugmentation.research.entering_fracture.0=Now that I am fairly certain dimensional fractures exist and lead somewhere, I should find and scan one of them to determine my next steps.
research.m_DIMENSIONALFRACTURE.text=Find a dimensional fracture
thaumicaugmentation.research.entering_fracture.1=My theory of natural fractures existing has proven to be correct. While it was a crucial step to entering the emptiness that lies beyond the fractures, there's one small problem. The fracture is not fully connected to the other side. Luckily, a burst of energy should be able to rip it open - which I now have the ability to create, in the form of Impetus.<BR>All I need to do is use a casting gauntlet with an attached and charged Impetus Conductor on the fracture, and after a few moments it should fully open. I have no idea what could be on the other side, although the ground around the fracture might give me some indication. Despite the possible danger, it's far too late for me to turn back now.
research.m_ENTERVOID.text=Find out what's on the other side
thaumicaugmentation.research.entering_fracture.2=While I was hoping for something a bit more interesting than a dark wasteland, I still think this place can be useful to me. There are many more fractures that are close together - they must lead to areas far away from each other, as even finding a single fracture before was not so easy. It also seems that many different dimensions can lead here. I might want to see if having an alternate entrance into any of them might be useful to me.<BR>If I want to open any more fractures in the future, I only need to repeat what I first did to get here - use a casting gauntlet with an attached (and charged) Impetus Conductor on the fracture and wait a few seconds.<BR>While most of this place seems eerily quiet, I can see that the tainted areas are full of life. I should be careful when travelling through these areas, as taint can be incredibly dangerous.
thaumicaugmentation.research.entering_fracture.3=Because Eldritch Guardians are tasked with guarding the places where the boundries between dimensions are weakest, I have a feeling that they may not appreciate me opening dimensional fractures. I should be prepared to deal with unwelcome visitors around any fracture that I open.

thaumicaugmentation.research.morphic_tool.title=Morphic Tool
thaumicaugmentation.research.morphic_tool.0=As I continue making innovations in the world of Thaumaturgy, I find myself creating increasingly superior equipment. At the same time, while my old equipment may not match these new innovations in effectiveness, I may find their appearance to be more suitable for my personal tastes. I shouldn't have to compromise between potency and vanity - I should attempt to discover a way to create a tool that can have the appearance of one item, but the other properties, both magical and mundane, of another. Perhaps I can expand upon the Primal Crusher's unique metaphysical properties for this purpose.
thaumicaugmentation.research.morphic_tool.1=I have created a method of effectively combining two items into the same space. With the help of a Primordial Pearl and a small amount of Vacuos, I can allow two items to exist in the same space, while only one is visible to outside observers. The other item is where this new Morphic Tool derives its other properties, such as strength and durability. While in this state, the decorative item is held in a state of suspension, meaning that while it cannot be damaged, it cannot interact with the world in any way.<BR>To create one of these tools, I need to set up an infusion with the item I want to keep the physical properties of in the center, and place the decorative item on an outer pedestal (with the other requisite items of course). If I ever want to separate these two items, I only need to place the tool into a crafting grid - it seems like separating the items from each other requires substantially less energy than morphing them together.<BR>As I mentioned before, the functional item is still at risk of breaking while metaphysically bound to the decorative tool. While combined, it cannot be repaired through traditional methods. However, materials such as Void Metal will still keep their regenerative properties. I am also certain that certain more complex items will not work properly while in a Morphic Tool - while basic tools and both regular and infusion-based enchantments seem to behave, items such as armor do not.<BR>Lastly, the Morphic Tool seems to provide a slight insulating effect against warp created by the functional item. Perhaps I should revist this phenomenon in the future to determine if I can make it more effective.

thaumicaugmentation.research.primal_cutter.title=Primal Cutter
thaumicaugmentation.research.primal_cutter.0=The Primal Crusher has proven itself to be a particularly useful tool, with it essentially being four tools near-simultaneously. Unfortunately, the Crusher itself is still limited in certain areas, namely for use as a weapon, as it is rather bulky and it takes time for me to raise it back up in between swings. Even then, it is a fairly blunt instrument. However, it should be feasible for me to apply the principle of morphic instability to a different set of tools... say, a set of cutting implements?
thaumicaugmentation.research.primal_cutter.1=My theory holds true, and I have prepared a new weapon: the Primal Cutter. Like its predecessor, it is actually four morphically unstable tools all fluctuating between each other so fast that they act like one implement.<BR>The main difference between this tool and the Primal Crusher is what tools have been used in its construction, with the Cutter acting very much like both an axe and a sword. It is much lighter than the Primal Crusher, and I can swing it very fast, allowing me to deal powerful cutting strikes against my foes.<BR>This weapon kept not only the Arcing ability of the Sword of the Zephyr and the Burrowing enchantment of the Axe of the Stream, but also two more unique abilities. The simpler of the two is a powerful sapping ability - stronger than that of the Void Metal Sword. The more interesting trait gained by the Primal Cutter is the ability to draw items and creatures closer to me by continuously using the weapon. While I can think of quite a few uses for this new ability, I must also be careful - drawn entities can move quite quickly towards me, and extra durability will be consumed from the weapon while this effect is being used.<BR>By placing the weapon in a crafting grid, this drawing ability can be toggled. This can be useful if I wish to use another tool or item in my offhand.<BR>Despite their drastically different capabilities, the Primal Cutter still shares some properties with the Primal Crusher. In addition to constantly regenerating like all Void Metal materials, it has also received the Primal Crusher's disquieting nature when held for long periods, trembling in one’s hand as the Void Metal morphs in between shapes imperceptibly. This will not discourage me from using it though, as it is far too useful a weapon to simply forget about.<BR>And I will not forget about it.

thaumicaugmentation.research.harness_base.title=Personal Flight
thaumicaugmentation.research.harness_base.0=To freely soar through the skies is something many wish they could do, and while it is technically possible for anyone to fly directly downward after jumping off a cliff, it might be a better idea to be able to fly in the other five directions as well. I do appreciate having intact legs, after all.<BR>While I have not made much progress in utilising Thaumaturgy to induce flight in any mobile form, there are still some things I can do in the meantime. I know I will need a wearable item to attach the flying mechanisms to, unless I want my hypothetical creation to shoot off into the stratosphere without me.
thaumicaugmentation.research.harness_base.1=I have designed a simple and relatively comfortable harness, with many buckles, straps, and connectors specifically aimed to allow the attachment of different arcane mechanisms and components. There is no point in wearing it in its current form, however, as it is simply a blank canvas for any flying devices to be built upon.<BR>With some further research, I can only imagine what different means of flight may be possible. I should take caution however, lest I become a faintly Thaumaturge-shaped crater at the bottom of a valley somewhere.

thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_harness.title=Thaumostatic Harness
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_harness.0=My recent invention of the Arcane Levitator has provided me with a very limited type of levitation-based flight, but ever since I completed that design I have wondered whether it would be possible to apply similar principles to a portable device that allows me to freely levitate wherever I desire. Some surface-level examination has revealed that this should be possible, but not simple.<BR>I will need to study levitation further, and ways to channel Vis appropriately to produce a stable levitating force. This might require me to study some fairly obscure sources of flight firsthand, so I should take steps to ensure my research will not be abruptly ended by an unexpected fall.
research.m_LEVITATE.text=Be lifted into the air by an external force
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_harness.1=The secrets of true levitation-based flight have been revealed to me, and I have now finalised my design for what I am calling the Thaumostatic Harness.<BR>The device operates by using stored Vis to anchor itself to the Aural Field, essentially hooking onto the ambient field the Aura creates. This will allow me to defy gravity for as long as the device has Vis. I must also continue wearing it, of course.<BR>To use the harness, I simply need to change it with Vis, equip it as a chest bauble and jump twice while in the air. To deactivate it, I can either land on solid ground or double jump again. With the amount of Vis the device can store, I should be able to fly continuously for a few minutes. However, while the Thaumostatic Harness is active, I will be unable to refill the Vis buffer. This means I will need to either land or unequip the harness for Vis-restoring items to work properly.

thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_gyroscope.title=Thaumostatic Gyroscope
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_gyroscope.0=Thaumostatic flight is somewhat prone to drifting. I do not come to an immediate halt when I stop moving, which while not a major issue can be annoying at times when precision is required.<BR>It should not be too difficult for me to design an upgrade that will make flight a little more stable, probably with some additional regulators in charge of controlling movement.
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_gyroscope.1=This new augmentation for the Thaumostatic Harness stabilizes flight greatly, preventing drift when I stop moving. These gyroscopic stabilizers carefully regulate the velocity output of the harness, ensuring that I can always come to a quick halt. Like all other augments, this upgrade can be combined with a Thaumostatic Harness by placing the harness and gyroscopes in a crafting grid, while placing an augmented harness alone in a crafting grid will remove the augment.<BR>Unfortunately, stabilized flight comes with a few downsides. The increased regulation required to allow stopping quickly also limits the maximum speed achievable with the harness, but this may not be so debilitating for precise tasks like building. I have also been forced to slightly reduce the size of the integrated Vis buffer by about 25%. However, the fact that the harness now moves more slowly should also lead to decreased Vis usage, so this may not be a problem in practice.

thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_girdle.title=Thaumostatic Girdle
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_girdle.0=While Thaumostatic flight is already an excellent mode of transportation, the speed of flight it provides is quite limited. I may be able to make some further adjustments to maximise the velocity output of the harness. Finding the right balance between speed and Vis cost may be a bit of a challenge, however.
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_girdle.1=As expected, I have been successful in creating an upgrade for the Thaumostatic Harness that raises the maximum speed I can fly at, without compromising too much in other areas. This Thaumostatic Girdle is an additional belt that allows the harness to draw more Vis from its internal buffer at once to facilitate faster speeds. It can be attached to the harness by combining them together in a crafting grid, while placing the augmented harness alone in the grid will remove the girdle.<BR>In addition to the aforementioned increased Vis cost, the Thaumostatic Girdle makes flight much less stable, meaning I need to be careful with the large amount of drift that can occur when I stop moving. On a more positive note, I was able to increase the size of the Vis buffer by 25% and allow the harness to support sprinting while flying for even faster speeds. Using this sprint ability comes at no additional Vis cost.

thaumicaugmentation.research.elytra_harness.title=Elytra Harness
thaumicaugmentation.research.elytra_harness.0=In my multidimensional travels I have happened across a truly fascinating object: a pair of insectoid gliding wings. While a great deal of their origins are shrouded in mystery, I do know that these wings come from hovering ships docked at the abandoned cities in the outer islands of The End. Clearly some long-deceased race of beings once created these cities and used these wings, though whether their origins were mundane or magical is unclear to me. It makes me wonder what their relation was to the abandoned structures littering The End: were they used by scouts to protect trade ships? Wage wars with mighty floating vessels against rival cities? While I do not think I will be unlocking any major secrets about the structures, at least I have these wings to examine.<BR>This elytra is unique in that instead of offering direct flight, it provides a surprisingly versatile means of gliding, enabling me to attain impressive speeds of I dare to push the limits of both the wings and my bravery.<BR>However, the elytra do have a few shortcomings. First and foremost, I cannot wear them at the same time as any other chestplate or robe. They also suffer from degradation quite quickly while in use, requiring almost constant maintenance. After I become accustomed to the style of gliding these wings provide, I should be able to apply some Thaumaturgical principles to solve both of these issues.
research.m_ELYTRAFLY.text=Gain some experience flying with elytra
thaumicaugmentation.research.elytra_harness.1=I have managed to create a successful design for an upgrade to the elytra. The flight harness I previously designed acts as the base for these upgrades, and allowed me to make quite a few improvements.<BR>Firstly, the Elytra Harness can be worn as a chest bauble, meaning I no longer have to choose between armor and gliding. Despite relocating the elytra to this area, its mode of operation is still the same: jump while falling to begin gliding.<BR>Second, I have done a great deal to mitigate the poor durability of the original elytra. My first modification was adding a light void metal weave throughout the wings. While they are still burdened by durability, this allows the wings to slowly repair themselves when not in use. Furthermore, I have also applied a protective ward that allows Vis to be consumed instead of damaging the wings. This protective shield only contains 50 points of Vis, and cannot be regenerated while in the air, but it can prevent any durability from being lost on shorter flights.<BR>Even with all of my improvements, it is still possible for the elytra to break mid-flight in extreme situations. I should carefully monitor their condition to ensure I do not suddenly drop out of the sky. Thankfully, in the event this does occur, the elytra will still be functional after they are given time to repair themselves.<BR>Lastly, I took the opportunity to allow the Elytra Harness to have a bit of a personal touch. I am able to apply any kind of banner to replace the appearance of the wings with that of the banner. This applies to mundane banners, which will apply their colour and patterns to the elytra, but also for Thaumaturgic banners, which will apply their colour and aspect insignia. For added flair, the color of the banner will also be applied to the sparkling trail that appears as I fly.<BR>Other cosmetic items may work as an upgrade as well - there is no harm in trying to see if it does indeed work.<BR>To apply a banner or other upgrade, I just need to place it and the harness in a crafting grid. Removing the upgrade is as simple as placing the harness by itself in a crafting grid.

thaumicaugmentation.research.elytra_booster.title=Elytra Boosting
thaumicaugmentation.research.elytra_booster.0=Despite how effective elytra gliding can be, there is one major problem with it: it is not true flight. It requires finding a high enough point to fall from to gain a decent amount of momentum; if I am in a flat area, I am out of luck. I suppose I could use a mundane contraption with pistons and slime blocks, but that requires setup ahead of time and is not a mobile solution.<BR>I do have some inspiration to work off of, in the form of fireworks. If I am gliding and set off an ordinary firework, it will boost me a fair distance. This method is not particularly good, however. It requires large amounts of gunpowder to be sustainable, and I can only carry so many of them. Besides, any self-respecting Thaumaturge such as myself would not want to be caught resorting to such mundane measures.<BR>I considered using Vis to emulate the boosting effect of a firework, but the protective durability shield of the Elytra Harness already uses Vis, and I am uncertain that Vis would be able to produce a strong, pushing force anyway. My recent discovery of the more volatile Impetus, however, opens up some new possibilities.<BR>I will need to study mundane fireworks first, and from there I can begin the process of recreating their pushing effect with a device that uses Impetus energy. I will need to be even more cautious than usual, as I will be experimenting with both explosive gunpowder and chaotic void energy. It seems that my research always leads me to danger, no matter how mundane or magical it might be...
thaumicaugmentation.research.elytra_booster.1=By emulating the explosive force of fireworks with Impetus, I can finally elevate the Elytra Harness to the level of true flight. The Impetus Thruster upgrade, as I have named it, expels stored Impetus to quickly increase my velocity in the direction I am looking.<BR>This augment can be attached and removed in the usual way: placing it with the Elytra Harness in a crafting grid to attach it, and placing the harness alone in the grid to remove it. I will also need to charge it with Impetus using one of my previously discovered methods.<BR>To activate the thruster, I only need to hold jump. To conserve Impetus, I may wish to boost in short bursts by holding down jump for short intervals, as the thruster does have a limit to how fast it can make me move.

thaumicaugmentation.research.more_golemancy.title=Further Golemancy Studies
thaumicaugmentation.research.more_golemancy.0=While I have made great strides in Golemancy thus far, sometimes working with golems can be a bit... inconvenient. I should research some ways to reduce my frustration with them.

thaumicaugmentation.research.autocaster.title=Autocaster
thaumicaugmentation.research.autocaster.0=I have already had success in the creation of automated weaponry, with Automated Crossbows being rather effective for use in ranged defense. However, despite the complex magical mechanisms used in their creation, they still only fire mundane arrows (although potion-tipped arrows can create some interesting effects). I personally have the option to use a different means of ranged attack in the form of foci, so I now wonder if it is possible to automate this as well.<BR>This will not be a simple matter however, since casting even simple foci requires an understanding of the ebb and flow of the magical energies involved and knowledge of how to correctly focus Vis, both of which require an intimate connection with the aura. Making a mere machine do all of this will not be an easy task.<BR>Fortunately, it seems I am not alone in this train of thought, as my recent discovery of ruins in the Emptiness has revealed ancient automatic spell-casters held within, which I may be able to reverse-enginneer in order to design my own.
thaumicaugmentation.research.autocaster.1=This was not an easy device to finalise, but with the understanding of the ancient spell-casters and with some effort spent into better connecting machines to the Aura, I have completed my plans for what I am calling the Autocaster. Reverse-engineering the ancient device was cruicial here; it was quite ingeniously designed, and I now better understand how one can recreate the spiritual connection a sentient being might have to the Aura in something mechanical.<BR>As with the original Eldritch casters, it consists of a central sphere (an unusual choice in this distinctly cuboid world perhaps, but it seems to be the most optimized design) which contains most of the mechanisms. The sphere is gently levitated on a metal base, which allows it to rotate freely. I can place it on any solid floor, wall, or ceiling, and the Autocaster will immediately begin looking for targets. Because I integrated biothaumics into the design of this device, I can configure what it targets through its interface, accessible by right-clicking it.<BR>However, the device can do nothing without a focus. I can attach one through the Autocaster's menu, simply by placing it in the dedicated slot. With a focus attached and an appropriate target found, the device will begin using Vis from the local aura to cast spells at the target. If there is not enough Vis nearby it will fail to cast the spell, as would be expected. It is no Thaumaturge, however, so the foci cast are only as effective as those used in a basic Caster's Gauntlet. This also means that it will be unable to receive any augmentation to improve its casting. Much like my other automated devices, I can deactivate it by providing a redstone signal (as long as this feature is enabled in its menu), and interacting with the Autocaster while sneaking will allow me to pick it back up.<BR>Despite it not being as effective as a seasoned Thaumaturge like myself, it still can use nearly all of the focus effects that I can. Therefore, I could get very creative with how I use this device. Lastly, I should note that while I can configure what the Autocaster targets, this only determines what it will attempt to fire spells at. It will not change how the focus effect naturally behaves. For example, if I have a focus effect tuned to home in on a hostile target and the caster configured to target myself, then the spell will be fired in my direction but then may still home in on any hostile mobs that are in the area. I could create some very complex systems with this behavior, but I should be careful to ensure that it only does what I intend it to.
thaumicaugmentation.research.autocaster.2=With my discovery of focus effects that use Impetus in their casting process, I should note that the Autocaster will not be able to cast them without external assistance. This assistance can be in the form of any device capable of transferring normal, uncharged Impetus at a distance. The Autocaster can store a very small amount of Impetus in some of its Eldritch-derived components, but nowhere near the level of an Impetus Cell. I should ensure it has reliable access to Impetus to maintain continued operation.

thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_shield.title=Void Shield
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_shield.0=With my recent expeditions into the Emptiness and the ruins that lie within it, I have discovered that certain particulary powerful creatures have the ability to summon magical shields that follow them around and block my attacks. They are quite effective at defending said creatures, and as such I would very much like to recreate them for myself.<BR>While I could settle for carrying around a physical shield, I would like to replicate the magical nature of the shields I saw. I will need to find a way to summon them on-demand, and I believe that I can do so via a special focus effect.<BR>In order to design this focus effect, I will need to study both the protective magic of warded arcana, but also the more esoteric area of Impetus. The former makes enough sense for this application, but I require the latter as summoning large semi-physical objects with Vis alone is very difficult. Impetus should provide enough force to be able to create tangible shields that follow me around.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_shield.1=By studying both Impetus and defensive foci, I have designed a new focus pattern that can create shields very similar to those used by the powerful entities in the Emptiness. This Void Shield focus effect uses the structured magical power of the praecantatio aspect, and not praemunio as I first anticipated - the latter resulted in effects that were far too static.<BR>To even use this focus effect, I will need to have Impetus available for my Caster's Gauntlet to consume, such as from a charged Impetus Conductor. Failing to have enough Impetus available will result in the shield failing to materialize.<BR>Assuming I do successfully create a shield, it will follow and protect the entity it was cast on. I can target any entity with this effect, not just myself, but missing an entity completely will result in no shield being created. If I wish to remove a summoned shield, I only need to sneak while casting the focus effect on the target. I can only remove shields that I created, however.<BR>This shield will follow its target and remain in front of their view. It will also block other creatures and projectiles from walking through it. It will never block me, and it will even allow most of my attacks to pass through unaffected. As with everything magical, however, there are always exceptions, so I should experiment ahead of time to ensure I do not accidentally damage my own shield in the heat of battle.<BR>I can control two variables relating to Void Shields in the Focal Manipulator. The first is the shield's durability, which dictates how much damage it can take before dissapating, as well as how long the shield can exist in the world for before decomposing. I also have the option of reflecting projectiles hit by the shield, causing them to bounce back in the direction they came from. Unfortunately, the shield will still take damage when reflecting projectiles.

thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_water.title=Focus Effect: Water
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_water.0=I have already managed to create multiple focus effects that harnessed the power of the primal elements. However, there is one that I have neglected thus far: Aqua. Although Gelum is similar, and water is generally seen as fairly benign, it may still be useful.<BR>I will need to examine water even more than I already have to better understand its potential. I have already managed to use Vis to conjure water with the Everfull Urn, so I have a good starting point for conjuring water by hand. I might need to personally study large amounts of water first hand, but as I can already create water this should be a trivial matter.
research.m_LONGTIMEINWATER.text=Dive to the deep depths
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_water.1=After a somewhat unpleasant and very soggy underwater experience, the power of water is now at my fingertips.<BR>This new focus effect will allow me to summon a torrent of water that can cool lava into solid blocks, fill water receptacles such as cauldrons and crucibles, hydrate farmland, and extinguish fires on surfaces and creatures. Fires will even be put out in a fairly large area around the area where it is cast, so I do not need to aim it directly at them. The water will also quickly dissipate afterwards if not aimed at a liquid container, so I do not need to worry about creating floods.<BR>While this effect's usefullness in combat is limited the majority of the time, this is not true for all creatures. The fiery blaze, as an example, will find this effect to be particulary potent. On the other hand, it will completely fail to harm mobs that are native to the water, giving them a chance to breathe on land instead. I suppose this is what is to be expected from trying to drown a fish, after all.

thaumicaugmentation.research.fortified_glass.title=Fortified Glass
thaumicaugmentation.research.fortified_glass.0=There are quite a few entries in the old manuscripts covering Warded Arcana, but one of the most unique is that of Warded Glass. While ancient Thaumaturges seem to have had little trouble in creating it, the notes covering this section are obnoxiously incomplete, and such I have been unable to properly recreate the glass so far. Despite all of my efforts, I simply cannot find a way to integrate a Warding Sigil to something that is less active than a door or chest.<BR>I could perhaps study Warded Jars a little more, but they are only warded in the sense that they are resistant to certain substances or sources of damage, so I am unsure if they will provide any inspiration. I am sure I can come up with something to show for my efforts, but it may not be quite like what is described in these manuscripts.
thaumicaugmentation.research.fortified_glass.1=While fully warded glass has to remain a dream for now, I have come reasonably close, given the limited amount of information I had to work off of. This material I am calling Fortified Glass essentially uses the same process that I use for creating Warded Jars, but scaled up to a full block.<BR>This glass is not completely indestructible, but it is very resistant to mundane damage. Explosions, for example, should be no problem for it. I also find it is rather aesthetically pleasing, so I might be able to find a use for it in decoration.<BR>Given that I managed to create a full cubic meter of this glass, creating panes out of it is rather simple. Other than the reduced size, Fortified Glass Panes retain all of the physical properties of the original.

thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_rift.title=Starfield Glass: Rift
thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_rift.0=The Void between dimensions is an inhospitable place that can hardly be called a place at all. It is hostile to life, to matter, it can house horrors I can scarecely imagine... but it is also so captivating.<BR>I cannot quite put it into words, but something about the starry void that I sometimes as the result of dimensional manipulation is so very intriguing. Given the chance, I am sure I could spend hours simply staring into it. Something tells me I should not do this, for many say one should not gaze into such an abyss, but I really cannot help myself.<BR>Despite the allure of the Void, I would rather not have to interact too closely with such dangerous dimensional magic too often. However, it should not be too difficult to create a contained breach in dimensions that can create the same effect with none of the risks involved. Or, at least, with the risks safely contained inside a piece of Fortified Glass.
thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_rift.1=Ah, this will be perfect. Fortified Glass was a great choice given my requirements, and now with only a very simple application of dimensional magic I can create Starfield Glass. I can now stare into the Void for as long as I desire, and there will be no need to work around unsafe dimensional anomalies in order to get a proper view.<BR>While it may look dangerous it is, in fact, perfectly safe, as the breach in dimensions is very weak and safely contained within the sturdy glass. It may also appear as if stepping into it would either lead one to The End or into a hostile abyss that would tear one to shreds in an instant, but I can rest assured that there is no risk of any unexpected teleportation, nor of any tears appearing in the fabric of reality from which untold chaos is invited into the world.<BR>Perfectly safe.<BR>Starfield Glass should be ideal for decorating anything I build. In fact, I believe that I may be able to make modifications to its appearance in the future. It would only involve some simple tweaks to the nature of the dimensional breach, or where precisely it leads to.

thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_mirror.title=Starfield Glass: Mirror
thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_mirror.0=Magic mirrors of all kinds send matter through the Void between worlds in order to transport it from one mirror to another. I can see into this space by looking into a linked magic mirror of any type, but my view is limited by the edges of the frame. I would very much like to get a proper look into this space, since it seems strangely different to the Void I have seen through rifts, and with a better view I might be able to learn more about it.<BR>I have already managed to create Starfield Glass that contains a view similar to that of a rift, so with some simple modifications to the dimensional breach it should be possible to make the window look into the exact space magic mirrors lead to.
thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_mirror.1=With only some minor adjustments to my previous Starfield Glass, I now have a new type which views the same starfield that can be seen inside magic mirrors. This variant of the glass is still perfectly safe, as the glass does not push items into a higher dimensional space like a mirror does.<BR>With this new insight gained into the space behind magic mirrors, I have learned more about its nature. From what I can tell, this space is still a Void, but it is a more compressed section of it. This unique compression of the dimensional plane allows matter to be sent through with the help of sympathetic mirror magic. While the appearance differs from that of a rift, it shares its hostility to life or anything akin to it. 

thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_fracture.title=Starfield Glass: Dimensional Fracture
thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_fracture.0=With my discovery of dimensional fractures, and my recent expeditions into the Emptiness via said fractures, I have noticed that the starry sky visible in both is oddly similar and yet remarkably different to the Void visible through flux rifts. I'd quite like to get a proper look at this fascinating view... purely for research purposes, of course.<BR>This should be easy to do, as I just need to modify my previously created Starfield Glass so that it is attuned to the specific part of the Void the Emptiness exists within. It will not be stable enough to allow objects to pass through without consequences, but for visual purposes it should suffice.
thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_fracture.1=A trivial task really, and now I can build a new type of Starfield Glass which views the same sky that can be seen in the Emptiness and inside of dimensional fractures. As before, there is zero risk of cross-dimensional travel when stepping into it, and as such it is perfectly safe to use for decorating my lab or home.<BR>With all of these studies, I am starting to better grasp the truth of the Void. It is a very strange truth, with the Void seeming to be a paradoxical mix of nothing and yet also 'something', as empty space is still a tangible concept in itself (which can be seen by the presence of the Vacuos aspect). The exact 'something' is very chaotic, however as it is so vague it constantly fluctuates in numerous states that act like baseline reality, like nothing and also like something completely different to reality and nothing. These fluctuations disrupt and likely destroy anything more tangible that comes into contact with them. Furthermore, the Void is so vast that, in certain sections of it, these fluctuations may balance out to a limited degree, giving these parts particular characteristics and appearances. The factors that determine these properties I do not, and perhaps cannot, fully know.<BR>It is difficult to put into words something that actively defies them, and much still perlexes me, even with my capacity for knowledge. Perhaps I should spend some time with a proper view into the Void, so I can better enlighten myself to the vastness of the Universe and that which goes beyond it. Some may accuse me of staring into space, but 'space' would imply that there is nothing to see, which in this case is evidently not true.

thaumicaugmentation.research.more_mechanisms.title=More Mechanisms
thaumicaugmentation.research.more_mechanisms.0=With my new access to magical types of wood and stone, I may wish to make simple mechanisms out of these materials instead of their mundane counterparts. It will not be a challenge to replicate simple contraptions, such as pressure plates and buttons, with different materials.
thaumicaugmentation.research.more_mechanisms.1=I have designed variants of pressure plates and buttons that use my new materials instead of normal wood and stone. The new wood buttons and pressure plates can be made from either silverwood or greatwood, and they act like their oak counterparts. Arcane stone acts in a similar way to average stone.<BR>One interesting note is that I only seem to be able to create these alternate mechanism designs using an arcane workbench. Whenever I attempt to build the wooden mechanisms without it, the end results look suspiciously close to oak wood. I am not quite sure why I cannot seem to keep the distinct appearance of these materials when crafting them on my own, but I suppose I should appreciate the assistance of the arcane workbench.

thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_openers.title=Arcane Mechanisms
thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_openers.0=Redstone mechanisms are extremely versatile and useful, even to a Thaumaturge like myself. One issue with them, however, is that I cannot control who can activate them in some cases. It is all well and good to have pressure plates handle opening my doors, until I have a monster infestation in my house. With my recent rediscovery of Warded Arcana, however, I think I can solve this problem.<BR>First of all, I think my greatwood, silverwood, and arcane stone mechanisms are good candidates for this task. Not only are they visually appealing, but their aptitude for magic should make it easier for me to ward them. The only challenge left will be making the ward allow activating the mechanisms but not otherwise affecting them, but if I was able to do this to a chest, I am sure I can do the same to these devices.
thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_openers.1=I have successfully created warded versions of each of the silverwood, greatwood, and arcane stone mechanisms. They will only activate by my actions alone, ignoring those created by any other entity. If they are activated, they will produce a redstone signal in the same way as their mundane counterparts.<BR>As usual, to remove a permanently warded object, I need to sneak and interact with the object while holding a caster's gauntlet to remove it.
thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_openers.2=I have discovered an interesting interaction between my arcane mechanisms and arcane doors. Despite the fact that arcane doors ignore normal redstone signals, it seems that adjacent arcane mechanisms can cause them to open if activated. This will only occur if the door recognizes the creature activating the mechanism as permitted, however, so I do not need to worry about someone using this property to bypass my Arcane Doors. I should also note that this only applies to the immediate area around the mechanisms - they are not able to be transferred over distances like redstone signals.

thaumicaugmentation.research.eldritch_spire.title=Exploring the Emptiness
thaumicaugmentation.research.eldritch_spire.0=There is more to the Emptiness than I have once expected. One might assume a world so close to the Void could not be anything but a barren wasteland, but alongside the areas infested with taint there is something that sets my teeth on edge. Something that has pierced its way in this place like a splinter in the skin of the dimensional boundaries. I cannot be too surprised, as reality here is far more malleable due to the many fractures that have been made in it, and how one wrong step can send me tumbling into an inhospitable abyss. With reality that unstable, it was almost guaranteed that some malicious influence would appear or otherwise make its way here - if they were not here from the beginning.<BR>For a while now, I have slowly been coming to the realization that the Eldritch may refer to far more than a branch of Thaumaturgy, or to knowledge that can twist one’s mind with Warp. The Crimson Rites, in particular, was filled with uses of the phrase ‘The Eldritch’ in ways that would put it far above that, in a way that would suggest that merely knowing that such things exist is something reserved to those who are destined to go beyond the mundane world I have come to know. To them, uttering the phrase must be almost blasphemous, something that no ordinary being should ever be allowed to do, let alone a Thaumaturge such as myself.<BR>No, the Eldritch cannot simply refer to this branch of magic centered around the Void. Instead, I believe it refers to a race of beings that have existed for a very, very long time, and who have had an effect on the world that has shaped much of what I treat as fact, or as being perfectly normal. If they exist, it could explain many of the oddities I have discovered, particular quirks in magical principles, why certain creatures are present in the world, and how some can lose their minds so utterly that they form sects made entirely of madmen dedicated to a ritual that can do nothing good.<BR>If I am to fully understand any of this, I will have to explore the Emptiness further, to discover what exactly is causing this disturbance in the aura. This Eldritch influence will almost certainly be hostile to something as comparatively small as myself, but knowledge often requires risk, and I cannot turn back now. Not with the power that such knowledge may offer me.
thaumicaugmentation.research.eldritch_spire.1=I have found something in the Emptiness. Ruins, ancient, created and placed here for a reason I do not know, although I am certain it is the work of the Eldritch. I can feel the disturbance in the surrounding magic field very strongly here, so this is precisely what I was looking for. Or, perhaps, these ruins contain what I am looking for.<BR>The ruins themselves are made up of many different parts, a series of chambers built around a central spire. At the bottom of this spire are a set of unusual doors, constructed using a form of magic that I am not entirely familiar with, although I do recognize the the presence of dimensional magic within their mechanisms. The lock at their centre seems to be a receptor for something, and I believe impetus might be the key. A charged impetus conductor attached to a caster's gauntlet should suffice - I only need to use it on the lock to open the door and unleash whatever lurks inside.<BR>While I cannot find out more until I enter the ruins, one important thing I have noticed is that a powerful protective ward is being held upon these ruins, likely by a powerful force within them. Until I enter these ruins and destroy the source of this power, I will be unable to break my way through the dungeon. Some chunks of stone seem to have been damaged over time, however, and the ward seems to have faded from these locations. In the event I find any of these weakened segments blocking my path, I should be able to break them freely.<BR>Given the size, complexity, and unnerving feel of these ruins, whatever lurks within them will almost certainly pose a threat to me. If I am not properly prepared for a fight, I should probably head back home and make preparations before I continue. Having come so far, it would truly be a shame to die now at the hands of that which I am trying so hard to fully understand.
thaumicaugmentation.research.eldritch_spire.2=I have made excellent progress with translating the ancient scrolls, and while what I have learned is perhaps not what I expected, it is precisely what I needed. As I suspected, the parts I translated cover two main areas of magic: Auromancy and Impetus. I shall cover each area separately.<BR>Firstly, Auromancy. This was one of the areas of translation that confused me the most, and for a very good reason: it seems that the aura of the distant past was quite different than the one I am familiar with. The aura in its current state is a field of magical energy, vis, that exists in higher dimensions and which permeates through many dimensional planes in fluctuating amounts. Certain areas and dimensions have weaker dimensional boundaries thus more vis is able to seep in, and the inverse is equally true. However, these scrolls reveal that the aura was not always like this, and that the connection to the other side was once far more tangible and focused, semi-physically present in the form of ‘Aura Nodes’. Vis would have to be directly drawn from these nodes in order to cast spells or operate devices, instead of simply drawing it from the surrounding area. Furthermore, the vis would come naturally attuned to different aspects, as opposed to having to manually attune the vis via essentia crystals or foci. This explains some of the oddities in design I noticed about the older wands I abandoned in favour of my gauntlets: they were designed for a very different version of the aura.<BR>Something very clearly happened to the aura nodes, and based on some rough theory working I have performed I can ascertain that they dispersed over a very long period of time. Initially, they spread out to a limited degree, with nodes feeding the surrounding area with different types of vis (meaning that at this period of time drawing vis directly from nodes for use in magic was not viable, and instead it was drawn from the area like I do now). Eventually, this dispersion became so severe that the nodes vanished entirely, leaving only numerous tiny invisible dimensional cracks from which pure non-attuned vis could flow through. However, I am fearful as to what may have induced this process. At first I thought it might have been a natural process, the aura gradually evolving over the aeons, but this does not seem right. There are, however, some strong hints at a true answer revealed by the next section.<BR>Secondly, the scrolls provided some tantalizing hints about impetus and how I might be able to better manipulate it. Notably, the text in this section of the notes is hastily scrawled, and the tone within seems to be far more urgent. While the writer seemed perplexed as to the nature of impetus (a feeling I can attest to), they did manage to provide me with a formula for a specialized jewel that can effectively resonate impetus energy, which should allow me to properly focus, transport and use it. In essence, I should be able to transmit impetus in the form of energy beams, given some extra research.<BR>I am a little puzzled as to the somewhat contradictory nature of the ancient mage’s understanding of impetus though. Apparently, they had struggled to find a way to create impetus reliably, despite their knowledge of how to properly focus and transmit it. With regards to the latter point, I believe it may be because they already had familiarity with using the ancient form of vis in a more focused fashion, transporting vis energy beams via crystal relays instead of drawing the energy from the surrounding area, and thus they had a starting point for which to use with impetus transfer. As for the former point, this implies something far more sinister.<BR>The only reason I can see for an accomplished ancient Thaumaturge being unable to reliably create impetus is that they did not have access to all of the magical phenomena that I do. If the nature of vis and the aura has changed over the aeons, then might that mean the nature of flux has never been fully consistent either? The presence of aura nodes would almost certainly have a big impact on how it would behave, and while I am not sure, I think the creation of flux rifts might not have been possible in their presence. If this is true, then there would be no reliable way to summon impetus energy, and thus an ancient Thaumaturge would have to rely on some other, likely far more dangerous, means of obtaining it.<BR>This troubles me. If flux rifts are a recent phenomenon, at least in terms of the vast timescales that entire universes operate by, then might this mean that something is forcefully attempting to shape reality in order to enable their creation? While this could be an entirely natural process, something about this all strikes me as so utterly twisted. What is happening to the aura to make it so… corrupt? If some malicious force wanted the creation of flux rifts to be possible, then perhaps it would explain the ancient aura nodes’ gradual disappearance, since without them there is nothing to prevent flux rifts from opening in high flux areas. But if this is all true, then why would this force want flux rifts to be opened at all, and how would it be able to manipulate the aura so entirely so to make aura nodes vanish? Do dimensional fractures and the Emptiness play a part here perhaps?<BR>I am loath to fully admit it, but if this is all true then I can only think of one force powerful enough to induce such a change in our world. The Eldritch. They want something with our world, with those who occupy it, with the Crimson Cult, with me, but I do not know what that is. I don't even know if I would be able to fully comprehend the answer if it was right in front of me. But I must continue my research nonetheless, because with this discovery I have been granted a great potential for power, and I know I can use this power to bend reality as I see fit. They will not stop me. Some might say they would travel to Hell and back to see their goals through, but the Nether is nothing next to the places I have been to, all to further my understanding of the forces that underlie magic.

thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus.title=Expanded Impetus
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus.0=With the wisdom I have gained from the scrolls of old, I believe I am now ready to fully unlock the potential of impetus. Previously I was able to use it to create void seeds, and after that collection and storage through manual use of a caster’s gauntlet, but with only a little more research I should be able to use the turbulent forces of the Void to do a great deal more than that.<BR>I already have a recipe for what is known as an Impetus Jewel, and while I know what it does in theory, I must now actually create one to see how it behaves in practice. The jewel, however, will only be capable of resonating impetus to receive and transmit it directly; therefore, I still need a way to draw impetus out of a flux rift in the first place. Fortunately, I have already done this previously, firstly with a Void Siphon and secondly with an Impetus Conductor. The former seems more appropriate a starting point for what I am aiming for, that being automatic collection of raw impetus. However, a Void Siphon requires a nether star, so I should probably endeavor to find a way to avoid needing them at all.<BR>Despite the effort this will take, these next steps will still be far simpler than getting past the dead-end I faced previously. At least I now have all of the fundamental knowledge required to actually do this.
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus.1=Now. Now I can truly begin to use impetus.<BR>Using the schematics I had previously created for the Void Siphon, I was able to modify the design so I could create the fundamental devices that can automatically collect, transport, resonate and distribute impetus. I shall cover how can one properly set up an impetus power system, and to do this I shall break it all down into separate parts that cover the different concepts, tools and devices involved.<BR>Before I begin, however, I feel I must note that when it comes to learning something new, more often than not the best way to understand something is to experiment with it physically. I should also note that impetus is complex topic for one to understand, and I would not be surprised if I happen to forget certain parts or get confused about impetus power mechanisms. Thus, if I am at all confused by what I am detailing, I might find it helpful to create and experiment with a few simple impetus energy setups so to better understand the principles involved firsthand. I suppose that I will have to see whether I prefer careful study or practical experimentation in order to fully understand this complicated and dangerous topic.<PAGE>Charged Impetus<DIV>Previously I only had access to impetus fairly indirectly, through the void seeds it created and the impetus stored in conductors attached to gauntlets. But with my new discoveries I am now able to gather impetus in a different more energetic form. I am calling this new form of impetus ‘Charged Impetus’. I shall cover the distinction between the two.<BR>Normal impetus can be seen as lines of starry void trailing through the air, and is usually directly pulled from a flux rift. It is what I have been using up until now and is what void siphons and impetus conductors use. Devices accessing normal impetus tend to be able to idly draw it from an impetus source, again, this usually being in the form of a flux rift. Notably, it is harmless for one to touch normal impetus trails… at least, probably, but they do at least seem to pass through me without any damage done.<BR>Charged impetus, however, is more volatile and therefore has a great deal more potential use. By making it take this charged form, I can transfer larger amounts of impetus over longer distances. It is what will power my planned specialized machinery, and can be seen in the world as beams of energy, which vary from faint to bright depending on how much charged impetus is being sent through them. Another difference from normal impetus is that charged impetus must be specifically directed to devices that use it, as opposed to drawing it from a nearby rift. I shall detail later on in this entry how to create charged impetus.<BR>For the sake of safety, I should note that an active beam of charged impetus has enough compacted energy to be rather deadly, and if I am caught between one then I will be hurt. Inactive beams, however, are safe. An inactive beam can be seen as faint wisps of energy, while an active beam glows bright and can be clearly seen.<PAGE>Impetus Nodes<DIV>Blocks placed in the world that connect to beams of charged impetus are collectively referred to as ‘impetus nodes’. To clarify: they have no relation to aura nodes. It does not matter whether a device creates, uses, or simply transfers charged impetus, if it connects to charged impetus beams in one form or another then it is classified as an impetus node.<BR>Impetus nodes have set numbers of input and output slots, which dictate how many beams of charged impetus can feed into and be sent out of them. Impetus nodes, therefore, can be designed so to transfer energy from one to the other, so a source of charged impetus can output energy into a node, and this node can output energy into another node, and so on and so forth. Different nodes have different numbers of input and output slots, for instance a device that creates charged impetus will only have output slots, a device that transfers charged impetus will have both inputs and outputs, and a device that uses charged impetus will only have input slots.<PAGE>Impetus Resonator<DIV>With impetus nodes having been detailed, there still needs to be a way to define how impetus nodes are connected to one another. For such a purpose, I have designed the Impetus Resonator.<BR>The Impetus Resonator is a tool which can modify the connections an impetus node has. By holding the device in hand and then sneaking and right-clicking an impetus node of any kind, said node will be clearly highlighted in blue and selected for modification. If I sneak right-click the same node again, it will be deselected.<BR>With an impetus node selected, I can then connect it to another node by right-clicking without sneaking on said other node. By doing this, the first node has been set to output energy into the second one, taking up an output slot on the first node and an input slot on the second. If I right-click the second node again, then the connection will be removed. To send energy from one node into multiple other ones, then I simply select the first node via sneak right-click and then right-click all the other nodes one-by-one. I should keep in mind the slot limitations when doing this, however. Also of note is that impetus beams can only travel so far, at a distance of around eight meters, and they cannot travel through opaque walls. Glass or other transparent materials will permit impetus beams to pass through them, however.I will need to ensure that impetus nodes are kept fairly close together and that they are not obstructed by walls in order to link them together properly.<BR>If I select an impetus node that already has connections defined, then I can also see these connections visualized. Any nodes that feed impetus into the selected node are highlighted in red, and any nodes the selected node sends impetus out to are highlighted in green. In the special case of a node being both an input and output of the selected node, it will be highlighted in purple. If am at all uncertain, I can also see in which direction impetus will travel based on which direction the beams are flowing.<BR>While the Impetus Resonator can define how nodes are connected to one another, very little will happen if no charged impetus is actually being fed into the system, which is where the Impetus Drainer comes in.<PAGE>Impetus Drainer<DIV>The Impetus Drainer is an important impetus node that creates charged impetus energy when placed next to a flux rift. Based on the Void Siphon, it has a dense piece void metal on top which draws in normal impetus (fortunately, the nether star was not needed here, since the siphon's only use for it is to coalesce normal impetus into void seeds), and using a rotating mechanism it charges the impetus and transmits it into an impetus jewel at its centre. It can therefore be seen as the heart of a charged impetus generation system. When the Drainer draws impetus out of a rift, the rift in question will gradually begin to shrink and become unstable, as with the Void Siphon. Draining a smaller rift will result in it drawing less impetus than if the rift was larger. Therefore, I should ensure that I keep an eye on the rift I am draining to ensure that it remains stable and sizable.<BR>The device itself has one impetus beam output slots and no inputs, since it creates charged impetus. Therefore, to send energy out of it and into other impetus nodes, I only need to sneak right-click it with the Impetus Resonator and then right-click on the other nodes in question.<BR>If I wish to disable the device, I only need to provide it with a redstone signal. This will stop the device from draining any nearby rifts and from creating impetus, so I can use this to ensure that I do not drain a flux rift too much.<PAGE>Impetus Relay<DIV>Probably the simplest type of impetus node, the Impetus Relay is simply a way to transport beams of impetus from one place to another. It has two input slots and two output slots, so I have some room to tinker with routing in my energy transport systems.<PAGE>Impetus Diffuser<DIV>This device can be seen as the inverse of the Impetus Drainer, since it takes in charged impetus and diffuses normal impetus from the top. Therefore, it can be used to power any devices that drain flux rifts directly, such as gauntlets with impetus resonators attached or void siphons. It has one input slots and no output slots, since it is a device that consumes charged impetus.<BR>I should note that the Diffuser cannot power the Impetus Drainer, since that could create feedback problems where normal impetus is converted to charged impetus, which is converted back to normal via the diffuser, which is then is sent back into the drainer which converts it to charged, which is sent back to the diffuser, etc.<BR>Of note is that using this device to power normal impetus devices will in fact be better for them than having them drain a rift directly. The charging process actively improves the efficiency of impetus creation, so it should be well worth the effort to use my new impetus power systems even with my older machines.<BR>As with the Drainer, I can turn the device off with a redstone signal, which will therefore prevent it from powering normal impetus devices.<BR>This covers the basics of charged impetus power systems. Despite my progress, I know that I have much more to learn and create, both with devices that transmit impetus but also those that use it.<BR>There is so much potential here, my mind is spinning with so many possibilities…

thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_gate.title=Impetus Gate
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_gate.0=Charged impetus power networks are already a rather complex topic to understand completely, consisting of many parts beyond just connecting nodes together. At the moment, I have no way to restrict the power transfer between two nodes without permanently severing the connection between them. This limitation exists due to the fact that I have not found a reasonable way to block an impetus beam within an impetus node itself; I can only redirect the beam.<BR>Normally, I would turn to redstone, as it excels at inhibiting magic. However, even redstone cannot fully inhibit a charged impetus beam, as the magical energy is just far too concentrated for it to handle. Thankfully, my studies into warding arcana may prove useful here. The protective magic that it covers could be indirectly used to "protect" something like an impetus relay from receiving a charged power beam, with this protective behaviour being adjustable within the device itself. I'll need to study this further in order to get the exact behaviour I need.
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_gate.1=I have confirmed that with some careful combination warded arcana and mundane redstone, it is possible to temporarily block charged impetus beams as I desired. When no redstone signal is given to the device, it acts as a normal impetus relay. When the redstone signal is applied, the protective shield enters a semi-solid state and prevents charged impetus from passing through in either direction. If the signal is removed, the shield will quickly dissipate and charged impetus can pass through as normal.

thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_matrix.title=Impetus Matrix
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_matrix.0=The charged impetus power I have discovered does have a great deal of future potential, being more volatile and immediately powerful than vis, and more flexible than the standard form of impetus I have used in the past. However, one major limitation of dealing with impetus in large amounts is the fact that it cannot be stored in any capacity after it has been extracted. Simply treating a flux rift as an impetus battery will only get me so far, as I have to work around the rift's precarious stability, not to mention the inability to extract more controlled amounts of impetus from it. Therefore, a means of storing larger quantities of impetus in a safe, or at least safer, manner would be ideal.<BR>I have already had success in storing small amounts of normal impetus. Looking at it from a wider perspective, I have done it through a fair few ways: in an impetus conductor for use in a casting gauntlet, in its coalesced and semi-physical form of a void seed, and most importantly inside a purpose-built impetus cell. These methods are all viable for normal impetus because while impetus itself is always volatile, it is nowhere near the levels of charged impetus. The crux of the problem is finding a way to keep it from growing too unruly while in storage, while also keeping it readily accessible at a moment's demand.<BR>After some time spent pondering this dillemma, I believe I might be able to achieve this. From what I can tell, unstable charged impetus is rather similar to the instability one can experience in a poorly maintained infusion process. When I was perfecting the art of infusion, I created the runic matrix to help regulate and stabilize infusions, and I think I may be able to reuse it in order to safely contain charged impetus. The exact implementation will almost certainly differ, of course, but I am confident that the idea is sound in principle.
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_matrix.1=I originally spent a great deal of time and effort designing a way to manage complex arcane infusions. It seems that even after meeting its initial goal, that effort has lead to a breakthrough yet again. Combined with a retaining structure similar to the aura node management devices of old, I have created a device I am calling the Impetus Matrix. Despite this not being the first time I have retrofitted an ancient design related to these nodes to support impetus, I am still left wondering if there is something greater hiding in the similarities between the two systems. I will make a mental note to return to this train of thought at a later date, for the Impetus Matrix deserves my immediate attention.<BR>To create an Impetus Matrix, I need to place a runic matrix between two eldritch pedestals, with one pedestal above and the other below the matrix. As with all mystical constructs, I need to use a pinch of Salis Mundus to form the full structure, and breaking any individual piece will revert it back to its discrete components.<BR>Once assembled, the Impetus Matrix requires some additional preparation to begin storing charged impetus. Firstly, impetus cells need to be inserted into the pedestals to act as the main storage receptacle. To insert a cell, I simply need to use it on the side of the pedestal I wish to insert it into. Each pedestal can hold up to four cells, one per side, for a maximum of eight total cells. The Matrix will be functional with even only a single cell. However, adding more cells will allow the Impetus Matrix to contain more charged impetus, as well as transfer more of that impetus in and out of the Matrix over a shorter period of time. Should I wish to remove a cell, I need to use the pedestal with an empty hand on the side containing the cell. Unfortunately, any excess impetus the remaining cells cannot store will be lost when doing this, so I should take care to not be wasteful.<BR>Secondly, the Matrix will need to be stabilized. When charged impetus is stored within the matrix, it will gradually begin to lose stability, with this stability loss growing as more charged impetus is stored. To stop this stability loss, I simply need to place the same occult paraphernalia that I use for the same purpose near infusion altars. The stability zone of the Impetus Matrix is smaller than that of the infusion altar, encompassing a five by five meter area. I still need to ensure that the objects are placed in symmetrical patterns around the central point of the Matrix, unless I want it to be even more unstable than without the objects. The same occurance of diminishing returns as I place the same kind of object occurs with the Impetus Matrix, so I may need to obtain many different items to store large amounts of charged impetus.<BR>Should the Impetus Matrix ever become unstable, it will begin to induce unpleasant effects around it, much like unstable infusions. It may discharge some of the stored impetus as bolts of harmful energy, knock impetus cells out of the pedestal, among some other harmful effects. Fortunately, the instability of an Impetus Matrix is less potent than that of an infusion, given the fact that it is not regulating an active crafting process with constant barrages of magical energy. This means that I will not need as many objects to have the Matrix reach a stable state as I might need for an infusion altar. I can also see the total stability gain and loss, as well as the approximate stability state, of the Impetus Matrix by looking at the central Runic Matrix with a pair of Goggles of Revealing.<BR>Finally, after following all of these steps, the Impetus Matrix will be ready to safely store charged impetus. The usual method of using an Impetus Resonator to direct impetus beams into and out of the Matrix applies here, with it being able to accept one input and one output. The colored runes on the matrix will show a rough approximation of how full the attached impetus cells are. Red represents a completely empty Matrix, yellow is partially filled, and bright green runes signify it being full. I can also attach a redstone comparator to any part of the Impetus Matrix to create a redstone signal that corresponds to the same information.

thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_mirror.title=Impetus Mirror
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_mirror.0=Long-distance transfer of charged impetus is a bit of a problem for me at the moment; because impetus beams can only travel a set distance, I need a great amount of relays and patience to link far away nodes together. There has to be a better way to go about doing this than the brute-force approach.<BR>Long distance transfer is something I have already successfully done with magic mirrors, but only with items and aerated essentia. It should be possible to use the same method to remotely connect impetus beams from one mirror to another, but it will require some special modifications to prevent the impetus from being ripped out of its concentrated, charged form. Since magic mirrors send materials through some corner of the Void, the impetus will naturally want to escape the mirrors and return to the realm it is more familiar with.
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_mirror.1=Despite the unusual nature of impetus, I have successfully managed to apply the principles of mirror magic to it, and I now have access to long-distance charged impetus transfer in the form of the Impetus Mirror. The mirror's design has obviously had to go under some adjustment, and therefore requires some more esoteric materials to craft it, but despite this it functions very similarly to any other kind of magic mirror.<BR>To use the mirror, I first need to create the usual pair of mirrors, place one in the world and use the second mirror on the placed one, linking the two together. I then simply place the second mirror at another location, and charged impetus beams can be sent through them. As with other magic mirrors, this link works across any distance and even across dimensions. However, the usual phenomenon of time seeming to stand still in places I am far away from still applies, so I will need to either be near the mirrors or set up a device counteract this effect if I want two mirrors that are very far away from each other to link.<BR>I can use the Impetus Resonator to connect inputs and outputs to the mirrors like any other node. Each mirror has a single input and output available for my use. This is separate from the intrinsic connection between two linked mirrors, which is effectively a bidirectional impetus link between them.<BR>While I am overall very pleased with the flexibility the mirrors offer me, they have a few limitations. The speed of impetus transfer had to be capped to prevent it from being torn apart in the Void, so I may need to be a bit more clever if I need high-throughput transfer. These mirrors also place the same strain on the aura as the other types of mirrors do, so frequently using the mirrors to transfer impetus will cause it to generate flux at both mirrors. Lastly, mirrors are much more expensive to craft than something comparatively simple like an Impetus Relay, so I should try to intelligently design my impetus setups to minimize their usage.

thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_management.title=Rift Management
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_management.0=As my usage of flux rifts increases, the rifts themselves seem to be fighting back. Not unexpected for a volatile tear in the fabric of magic, but I need to find ways to better manage them. An unstable rift is incredibly dangerous, prone to destroying whatever is around it.<BR>Before I begin investigating means of managing rifts, however, I shall first compile some notes on their behaviour I have noticed while working with them.<BR>Rifts form when too much flux appears in the local aura, around three-fourths of the total vis cap to be precise - a fact that I learned the hard way. If I am wearing Goggles of Revealing, I can faintly see the rift through the terrain, so if a rift appears in an unknown location I can use those to help locate it. The rift will continue to absorb the excess flux in the aura, growing in size as it does so. However, if there is no more flux to sustain the rift, it will become more and more unstable. There is also a point where even in the presence of flux, the rift cannot sustain its growth. This effectively sets a maximum size that rifts that naturally grow to.<BR>I have also observed some interesting characteristics about a rift's stability. A rift gains stability from absorbing flux, or in its abscence, an instability event, but I can also stabilize a rift with the redstone-based stabilizers I created for use in infusion. Using a stabilizer like this does present a problem in that it generates more flux than a single rift consumes, but I suppose it will have to do until I devise a better method for stabilizing rifts.<BR>One way of identifying a rift's stability at a glance is through its movement. A perfectly stable rift will appear to be perfectly stationary, but as it loses stability it will begin pulsing and shifting. If the rift starts releasing small wisps of energy, it has reached the point where it will create chaotic disruptions at any moment. I believe that these wisps are the rift discharging its unstable energies, with this energy coming from the chaotic Void on the other side of the rift which is "shaped" by the rift into unpleasant flux-related chaos.<BR>Instability effects vary, but they are unpleasant and potentially lethal. One of the most common events is the rift condensing the flux into a physical form, namely through a taint seed. If the seed is not quickly removed, the area around it will become a flux-filled mess, potentially setting off a chain reaction of more rifts forming. Other events include the release of proper wisps, the ones that zap anything that comes too close, as well as clouds of flux forming in the vicinity. In rare circumstances, the rift may naturally collapse, sealing the breach in reality on its own. This is the same process that is induced by a causality collapser, but occurs so infrequently that it probably is not worth waiting for.<BR>Finally, I should note that a flux rift's connection to the Void means that it interacts with physical matter in destructive ways. Flux rifts are capable of consuming all but the most durable of materials if they grow into them, not even leaving an item behind. Living matter will similarly be quickly destroyed on contact.<BR>With these behaviours documented, I believe I am now prepared to design some tools to better manage these rifts. Despite how dangerous they are, I know that they are crucial to my continued attempts to unlock all of the secrets Thaumaturgy has to offer.

thaumicaugmentation.research.impulse_cannon.title=Impulse Cannon
thaumicaugmentation.research.impulse_cannon.0=With the secrets of impetus power being gradually revealed to me, I believe it is time to put them to use in a somewhat... ubsubtle manner. Impetus is naturally more volatile than vis, and after some pondering I am left with a grim yet intriguing question: what if I were to try and weaponise it?<BR>Initially, I thought it might be possible to do this via a focus effect, where the ffect would channel impetus from a connected impetus conductor and unleash it as destructive energy. However, it would require great concentration on my part. Even the slightest lapse in attention would result in the impetus backfiring, destroying the focus before killing me, no doubt in a very unpleasant way. Additionally, even if such a focus posed no danger to me, the impetus conductor is a low-power device that is not suitable for the large burst of impetus that a weapon directly harnessing it requires.<BR>All of these problems are the result of me trying to apply an entirely new source of power to a casting method not inherently designed to accommodate it. If I were to instead build a device that can properly contian, stabilize, and fire the impetus, then I will almost certainly have far more success. I will also not be reduced to a pile of ashes drifting gently away from a smouldering crater.<BR>I unfortunately see no better trial to determine if this idea has merit than subjecting myself to the touch of a charged impetus beam. I have previously noted that the beams travelling between relays can damage living creatures, so if I have not already (whether deliberately or as a result of a mishap), I should touch one of them. It also must be in the process of transferring charged impetus, as the passive beams between nodes are harmless. I should also prepare some devices capable of stabilizing magic - I have the feeling that I will need them.
