thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumic_augmentation_base.title=Thaumic Augmentation
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumic_augmentation_base.0=I'll dedicate this section of the Thaumonomicon to any miscellaneous discoveries I make. Who knows what I may come up with?

thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_thaumium.title=Thaumium Caster's Gauntlet
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_thaumium.0=As I noted before, iron is a very poor vis conductor. It gets the job done, but now that I have discovered thaumium, it should be a simple task to upgrade my old caster's gauntlet prototype to be much more effective than before.<BR>While I am making modifications, I might as well investigate enchanted fabric's usefullness as a replacement for leather.
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_thaumium.1=I have successfully created the new casting gauntlet, which I am (uncreatively) calling the Thaumium Caster's Gauntlet. The introduction of Thaumium allows the caster to be more about 10% more efficient with the usage of Vis, in addition to slightly reducing the cooldown between casts.<BR>It seems that the enchanted fabric takes very well to dyes - I only need to combine the gauntlet with one or more dyes on a mundane crafting table to get a new color. To remove the dye, I need to use the gauntlet on a filled cauldron.

thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_void.title=Voidseer Caster's Gauntlet
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_void.0=While the thaumium casting gauntlet was certaintly a success, I can't help but wonder if void metal is as effective a vis conductor as thaumium is. Even if it isn't, I have trouble believing its morphic properties won't have some benefit. 
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_void.1=My results so far have been surprisingly disappointing. I have seen a small reduction in the vis cost of casting, but not enough to outweigh thaumium's faster recharge abilities.<BR>Perhaps I have been looking at the wrong component to improve...
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_void.2=It seems my previous conjecture has proven to be correct. Upon replacing the vis resonator with a voidseer's pearl, the gauntlet felt much more connected to the surronding aura. So connected, in fact, that not only have I measured a 30% vis discount over my original prototype, but it also absorbs vis over a much wider area. Hopefully this will mean I can cast with very complex foci without depleting the local aura nearly as quickly as before.<BR>It seems that while the cooldown time of this gauntlet is still better than the original caster, the thaumium gauntlet is still superior in this regard. I will have to decide which trait, vis usage or cooldown time, I find more valuable. Luckilly, the ability to dye the gauntlet was retained from its predecessor. The method to apply and remove dye is the same as for the thaumium gauntlet.

thaumicaugmentation.research.vis_regenerator.title=Vis Regenerator
thaumicaugmentation.research.vis_regenerator.0=As I have come to experience, a session of advanced arcane crafting or foci casting can leave the aura completely depleted. I should try to find something that can help regenerate the aura a bit quicker than letting it recover naturally.
thaumicaugmentation.research.vis_regenerator.1=I have drawn up plans for a device I am calling the Vis Regenerator. It consists of a lattice layer, made of silverwood leaves and an essentia filter, with an outer casing that attempts to "recirculate" the aura through the lattice.<BR>An interesting characteristic of this device is that the effectiveness seems to be tied to the total capacity of the local aura. In other words, areas that naturally have a low amount of vis will experience a higher rate of regeneration.<BR>If I need to disable the Vis Regenerator for any reason, applying a redstone signal should do the job.
thaumicaugmentation.research.vis_regenerator.2=Because of the Vis Regenerator's delicate relationship with the local aura, I should avoid using it in areas with a lot of flux. I have a feeling it would the make aura pollution much worse...

thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_copier.title=Seal Copier
thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_copier.0=Configuring golem seals by hand is fine for small projects, but when stacks of seals get involved it becomes tedious and error-prone. I should research a way to quickly configure large amounts of seals.
thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_copier.1=I have created plans for a basic seal copying device. I just need to configure one seal with the settings I need, then right click it with the copier. I then only need to right click every other seal I want to apply the settings to. If I want to clear the memory of the copier, I need to right click while sneaking. I can then copy new settings and continue.<BR>It seems that the seal copier is unable to interact with seals that were not placed by the owner. I should keep this in mind if I am working with other Thaumaturges.

thaumicaugmentation.research.more_auromancy.title=More Auromancy
thaumicaugmentation.research.more_auromancy.0=I have already discovered some foci effects, but I feel there is still much more to discover. There are so many aspects of essentia I have not experimented with, that I am bound to find something useful.

thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_light.title=Focus Effect: Light
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_light.0=While fire does give off light, it can be a bit... destructive. It should be somewhat simple to create an effect completely dedicated to giving off light. To begin, I should examine some light sources I already have access to.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_light.1=The light pattern does exactly what I was hoping - it creates a bright light source wherever it is used. The light source will even be able to last forever - meaning I can use it for permanent lighting if I wish.<BR>I do wonder what would happen if a living creature was exposed to this pattern's blast of light.

thaumicaugmentation.research.warded_arcana.title=Warded Arcana
thaumicaugmentation.research.warded_arcana.0=While browsing some of the old manuscripts in the Thaumonomicon, I came across a section that described the applications of warding arcana. Being able to create objects that are protected against everything except its owner sounds like something I should investigate. I should begin my studies by examining the warded device I have already created, the Warded Jar.
thaumicaugmentation.research.warded_arcana.1=My examination of the Warded Jar provided me with all I need to know - it should be possible to apply protective properties to almost all materials, so long as I apply a special rune to the object first. While I'm excited by the possibilities this can lead to, I think it would be best to start with something simple - like a chest.
thaumicaugmentation.research.warded_arcana.2=By taking a mundane chest and applying a warding sigil, I have created a container that is not only almost invoidable to all outside forces, but is also only accessible to me. This means I cannot use neither traditional methods of extracting and inserting items, such as hoppers, nor golems - maybe this is something I can look into in the future.<BR>Should I want to remove the chest, I need to sneak and then use any casting gauntlet on it.

thaumicaugmentation.research.arcane_door.title=Arcane Door
thaumicaugmentation.research.arcane_door.0=Now that I have the basics of warding objects down, I think I can move on to something a bit more advanced. The original manuscripts I read described an indestructable door, which sounds like something worth researching. After all, replacing doors broken down by zombies does get annoying after a while...
thaumicaugmentation.research.arcane_door.1=I have managed to create the warded door described in the manuscript, which I am calling the Arcane Door. Just like the Warded Chest, the doors will only open for their owner, and are extremely difficult to remove by normal means. I have also made two different styles - wood and thaumium. They both are functionally the same, but it is nice to have options for decoration purposes.<BR>If I want to remove the door, I need to sneak and then use the bottom half of it with any casting gauntlet.<BR>I have also created trapdoor forms of these doors. They work in the same way as the normal doors, just in a smaller profile.

thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_keys.title=Access Control
thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_keys.0=Being able to have private objects is nice and all, but sometimes I need to share my belongings with fellow Thaumaturges. I should devise a way to selectively grant access to those I want to permit.
thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_keys.1=I have created objects to allow others to access arbitrary warded objects - keys. But these are not any ordinary keys, as they will learn to emulate the person they are bound to. This seems sufficient to bypass the protections of the wards, provided the bound person matches with the object. Each key works slightly differently - I have written instructions for each type of key on the following pages, should I need to reference them.<PAGE>Iron Key<DIV><IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/items/key_iron.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG>These are the simplest of the three types of keys. To bind one to my warded objects, I need to use it on empty space (it does not need to be used on any block). It will then allow anyone possessing the key access. To unbind the key, I should use the key while sneaking.<PAGE>Brass Key<DIV><IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/items/key_brass.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG>This key functions in a similar way to the iron key - use to bind, sneak while using to unbind. However, the brass key has the ability to copy its binding to an iron key. To do this, one needs to place both the brass key and an unbound iron key in a mundane crafting grid. The brass key will not be consumed by this process. Copying thaumium keys will be described in the following section. <PAGE>Thaumium Key<DIV><IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/items/key_thaumium.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG>The thaumium key is interesting in that it does not only bind to beings - it also binds to the object and its location. In other words, this key will permit to access to a single warded object at a location. To bind this key, I need to use it on the warded object I want to bind it to. This binding will still be valid even if I remove and replace the object at a location, but only if it still matches the type of object the key was originally bound to. Sneaking while using the key will unbind it, like the others. To copy a Thaumium key, I need to combine it in a mundane crafting grid with an empty Thaumium key and a brass key bound to the same person as the thaumium key.

thaumicaugmentation.research.boots_void.title=Boots of the Riftstrider
thaumicaugmentation.research.boots_void.0=With void metal allowing me to upgrade most of my existing armor to take advantage of its superior capabilities, it only makes sense for me to try to apply this material to the Boots of the Traveler as well.
thaumicaugmentation.research.boots_void.1=I have succeeded in upgrading the Boots of the Traveler into a superior form I am calling the Boots of the Riftstrider. These boots have the expected boosts to speed and jump height over the original (at the cost of slightly increased vis consumption), as well as the auto-repair capabilities of all void metal items. Most notably, fall damage is greatly reduced beyond the jump height of these boots - I can practically fall into a ravine and walk away unharmed.<BR>These boots are also now dyeable. I simply need to craft them with the dye(s) I want to color them, or use them on a filled cauldron to wash away the dye.

thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_studies.title=Rift Studies
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_studies.0=I think that flux rifts are much more important to my studies than they may seem. When they are created from an excess of flux, they open and connect to the void. There must be a way to manipulate them to tear through to places that are more... hospitable.<BR>However, studying flux rifts currently requires me to saturate the aura with flux, which is very destructive to the local arua. Additionally, I cannot control exactly where the rift is formed when this happens, which creates a high risk of damage to life and property. If I can come up with a controlled method of creating flux rifts, studying them will be much easier.
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_studies.1=By concentrating a large amount of vitium essentia into a void seed, the flux created will be able tear a hole into the void. I should be very careful with these flux rift seeds - "planting" them will instantly open the rift, consuming the seed.<BR>Sadly, even with the amount of vitium I added to the seed, the rift created is somewhat small. If I need to make a larger rift for some reason, I should be able to infuse even more vitium and void seeds into the smaller rift seed to make it grow larger, creating a larger rift. However, not only does the instability and vitium cost in the infusion increase with size, but I only seem to be able to safely use this process once on any given rift seed.
