tc.research_category.THAUMIC_AUGMENTATION=Augmentation
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumic_augmentation_base.title=Thaumic Augmentation
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumic_augmentation_base.0=I'll dedicate this section of the Thaumonomicon to any miscellaneous discoveries I make. Who knows what I may come up with?

thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_thaumium.title=Thaumium Caster's Gauntlet
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_thaumium.0=As I noted before, iron is a very poor vis conductor. It gets the job done, but now that I have discovered thaumium, it should be a simple task to upgrade my old caster's gauntlet prototype to be much more effective than before.<BR>While I am making modifications, I might as well investigate enchanted fabric's usefulness as a replacement for leather.
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_thaumium.1=I have successfully created the new casting gauntlet, which I am (uncreatively) calling the Thaumium Caster's Gauntlet. The introduction of Thaumium allows the caster to be more about 10% more efficient with the usage of Vis, in addition to slightly reducing the cooldown between casts.<BR>It seems that the enchanted fabric takes very well to dyes - I only need to combine the gauntlet with one or more dyes on a mundane crafting table to get a new color. To remove the dye, I need to use the gauntlet on a filled, mundane cauldron.

thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_void.title=Voidseer Caster's Gauntlet
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_void.0=While the thaumium casting gauntlet was certaintly a success, I can't help but wonder if void metal is as effective a vis conductor as thaumium is. Even if it isn't, I have trouble believing its morphic properties won't have some benefit. 
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_void.1=My results so far have been surprisingly disappointing. I have seen a small reduction in the vis cost of casting, but not enough to outweigh thaumium's faster recharge abilities.<BR>Perhaps I have been looking at the wrong component to improve...
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_void.2=It seems my previous conjecture has proven to be correct. Upon replacing the vis resonator with a voidseer's pearl, the gauntlet felt much more connected to the surronding aura. So connected, in fact, that not only have I measured a 30% vis discount over my original prototype, but it also absorbs vis over a much wider area. Hopefully this will mean I can cast with very complex foci without depleting the local aura nearly as quickly as before.<BR>It seems that while the cooldown time of this gauntlet is still better than the original caster, the thaumium gauntlet is still superior in this regard. I will have to decide which trait, vis usage or cooldown time, I find more valuable. Luckilly, the ability to dye the gauntlet was retained from its predecessor. The method to apply and remove dye is the same as for the thaumium gauntlet.

thaumicaugmentation.research.vis_regenerator.title=Vis Regenerator
thaumicaugmentation.research.vis_regenerator.0=As I have come to experience, a session of advanced arcane crafting or foci casting can leave the aura completely depleted. I should try to find something that can help regenerate the aura a bit quicker than letting it recover naturally.
thaumicaugmentation.research.vis_regenerator.1=I have drawn up plans for a device I am calling the Vis Regenerator. It consists of a lattice layer, made of silverwood leaves and an essentia filter, with an outer casing that attempts to "recirculate" the aura through the lattice.<BR>An interesting characteristic of this device is that the effectiveness seems to be tied to the total capacity of the local aura. In other words, areas that naturally have a low amount of vis will experience a higher rate of regeneration.<BR>If I need to disable the Vis Regenerator for any reason, applying a redstone signal should do the job.
thaumicaugmentation.research.vis_regenerator.2=Because of the Vis Regenerator's delicate relationship with the local aura, I should avoid using it in areas with a lot of flux. I have a feeling it would the make aura pollution much worse...

thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_copier.title=Seal Copier
thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_copier.0=Configuring golem seals by hand is fine for small projects, but when stacks of seals get involved it becomes tedious and error-prone. I should research a way to quickly configure large amounts of seals.
thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_copier.1=I have created plans for a basic seal copying device. I just need to configure one seal with the settings I need, then right click it with the copier. I then only need to right click every other seal I want to apply the settings to. If I want to clear the memory of the copier, I need to right click while sneaking. I can then copy new settings and continue.<BR>It seems that the seal copier is unable to interact with seals that were not placed by the owner. I should keep this in mind if I am working with other Thaumaturges.

thaumicaugmentation.research.more_auromancy.title=Further Auromancy Studies
thaumicaugmentation.research.more_auromancy.0=I have already discovered quite a few elemental foci effects, but I feel there is still much more to discover. There are so many aspects of essentia I have not experimented with that I am bound to find something useful.

thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_light.title=Focus Effect: Light
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_light.0=While fire does give off light, it can be a bit... destructive. It should be somewhat simple to create an effect completely dedicated to giving off light. To begin, I should examine some light sources I already have access to.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_light.1=The light pattern does exactly what I was hoping - it creates a bright light source wherever it is used. The light source will even be able to last forever - meaning I can use it for permanent lighting if I wish.<BR>I do wonder what would happen if a living creature was exposed to this pattern's blast of light.

thaumicaugmentation.research.warded_arcana.title=Warded Arcana
thaumicaugmentation.research.warded_arcana.0=While browsing some of the old manuscripts in the Thaumonomicon, I came across a section that described the applications of warding arcana. Being able to create objects that are protected against everything except its owner sounds like something I should investigate. I should begin my studies by examining the warded device I have already created, the Warded Jar.
thaumicaugmentation.research.warded_arcana.1=My examination of the Warded Jar provided me with all I need to know - it should be possible to apply protective properties to almost all materials, so long as I apply a special rune to the object first. While I'm excited by the possibilities this can lead to, I think it would be best to start with something simple - like a chest.
thaumicaugmentation.research.warded_arcana.2=By taking a mundane chest and applying a warding sigil, I have created a container that is not only almost invoidable to all outside forces, but is also only accessible to me. This means I cannot use neither traditional methods of extracting and inserting items, such as hoppers, nor golems - maybe this is something I can look into in the future.<BR>Should I want to remove the chest, I need to sneak and then use any casting gauntlet on it.

thaumicaugmentation.research.arcane_door.title=Arcane Door
thaumicaugmentation.research.arcane_door.0=Now that I have the basics of warding objects down, I think I can move on to something a bit more advanced. The original manuscripts I read described an indestructable door, which sounds like something worth researching. After all, replacing doors broken down by zombies does get annoying after a while...
thaumicaugmentation.research.arcane_door.1=I have managed to create the warded door described in the manuscript, which I am calling the Arcane Door. Just like the Warded Chest, the doors will only open for their owner, and are extremely difficult to remove by normal means. I have also made three different styles - greatwood, silverwood, and thaumium. They are all functionally the same, but it is nice to have options for decoration purposes.<BR>If I want to remove the door, I need to sneak and then use the bottom half of it with any casting gauntlet.<BR>It seems that these doors are "smart" in the sense that two doors placed next to each other act as double doors and will open and close together. How convenient.<BR>I have also created trapdoor forms of these doors. They work in the same way as the normal doors, just in a smaller profile.

thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_keys.title=Access Control
thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_keys.0=Being able to have private objects is nice and all, but sometimes I need to share my belongings with fellow Thaumaturges. I should devise a way to selectively grant access to those I want to permit.
thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_keys.1=I have created objects to allow others to access arbitrary warded objects - keys. But these are not any ordinary keys, as they will learn to emulate the person they are bound to. This seems sufficient to bypass the protections of the wards, provided the bound person matches with the object. Each key works slightly differently - I have written instructions for each type of key on the following pages, should I need to reference them.<PAGE>Iron Key<DIV><IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/items/key_iron.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG>These are the simplest of the three types of keys. To bind one to my warded objects, I need to use it on empty space (it does not need to be used on any block). It will then allow anyone possessing the key access. To unbind the key, I should use the key while sneaking.<PAGE>Brass Key<DIV><IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/items/key_brass.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG>This key functions in a similar way to the iron key - use to bind, sneak while using to unbind. However, the brass key has the ability to copy its binding to an iron key. To do this, one needs to place both the brass key and an unbound iron key in a mundane crafting grid. The brass key will not be consumed by this process. Copying thaumium keys will be described in the following section. <PAGE>Thaumium Key<DIV><IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/items/key_thaumium.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG>The thaumium key is interesting in that it does not only bind to beings - it also binds to the object and its location. In other words, this key will permit to access to a single warded object at a location. To bind this key, I need to use it on the warded object I want to bind it to. This binding will still be valid even if I remove and replace the object at a location, but only if it still matches the type of object the key was originally bound to. Sneaking while using the key will unbind it, like the others. To copy a Thaumium key, I need to combine it in a mundane crafting grid with an empty Thaumium key and a brass key bound to the same person as the thaumium key.

thaumicaugmentation.research.boots_void.title=Boots of the Riftstrider
thaumicaugmentation.research.boots_void.0=With void metal allowing me to upgrade most of my existing armor to take advantage of its superior capabilities, it only makes sense for me to try to apply this material to the Boots of the Traveller as well.
thaumicaugmentation.research.boots_void.1=I have succeeded in upgrading the Boots of the Traveller into a superior form I am calling the Boots of the Riftstrider. These boots have the expected boosts to speed and jump height over the original (at the cost of slightly increased vis consumption), as well as the auto-repair capabilities of all void metal items. Most notably, fall damage is greatly reduced beyond the jump height of these boots - I can practically fall into a ravine and walk away unharmed.<BR>These boots are also now dyeable. I simply need to craft them with the dye(s) I want to color them, or use them on a filled, mundane cauldron to wash away the dye.

thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_studies.title=Rift Studies
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_studies.0=I think that flux rifts are much more important to my studies than they may seem. When they are created from an excess of flux, they open and connect to the void. I'm sure that they contain the secret to opening rifts into places that are more... hospitable.<BR>However, studying flux rifts currently requires me to saturate the aura with flux. It might be beneficial to contain all the flux I need into a small "seed" that can then be released into the target area, rather than having to resort to more messy alternatives. I should look into ways to compress a large amount of flux into a small space.
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_studies.1=By concentrating a large amount of vitium essentia into a void seed, the flux created will shortly be absorbed into the aura and almost certaintly create a rift. I should be very careful with these flux seeds - "planting" them will instantly release all of its contained flux, consuming the seed.<BR>It seems that limiting the essentia in the seed to strictly Vitium allows more flux to be created per unit of essentia than just dumping it into the aura. If I want to take advantage of this to create larger rifts, I should be able to infuse even more vitium into the smaller flux seed. However, not only does the instability in the infusion increase with the amount of Vitium added, but I only seem to be able to safely use this process once on any given flux seed.

thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_augmentation.title=Gauntlet Augmentation
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_augmentation.0=While creating improved casting gauntlets like the Thaumium gauntlet is great and all, at some point I will be unable to come up with designs for new gauntlets. Maybe I should spend some time thinking of ways to improve the designs I already have.<BR>The casting gauntlets I have created thus far all use a Vis Resonator to interface with the aura. Perhaps I can create a type of resonator that is specialized towards a specific aspect of essentia, instead of the entire spectrum of them. 
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_augmentation.1=After some simple tests, I can say with certainty that magnifying a single aspect is possible. Rather than removing the generic Vis resonator, I can instead attach this new resonator to it as a sort of filter. Because it is an addition to the existing mechanisms of the gauntlet, I believe I will call this new type of device an "augment".<BR>This new resonator should allow the gauntlet to more efficiently use a single aspect of essentia, allowing any focus effects with the same aspect to become more powerful. However, due to the way it "magnifies" the aspect, this process is only possible for a single aspect per gauntlet. Still, I'm excited to see just how effective this new augment system I have devised is in practice.<BR>While the plans I have drawn up use an Ordo crystal as an example, I should be able to use any type of Vis crystal, depending on which Aspect I want to make more powerful.
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_augmentation.2=Just as I thought, I have been able to create the final resonator without issue. Since it reacts strongly to a single type of essentia, I think the "Elemental Resonator" is a suitable name for it. One unforseen trait I have discovered is that while a single aspect reacts favorably, one or more other aspects will react negatively to the presence of the resonator. Which aspects they are seems to vary for each aspect. I should experiment with aspects I plan on using to ensure that the foci I wish to use aren't negatively affected.<BR>I can place the Elemental Resonator with any vis crystal in a crafting grid to swap out the internal crystal. I will be able to get the old crystal back as well.<BR> As for the augment system itself, I have designed it to be fairly modular. Because of this, it is possible to add and remove augments an unlimited number of times. To apply an augment, I only need to place it with the item to augment in any crafting grid. While it looks like these casting gauntlets should be able to support at least 3 augments without issue, combining multiple of the same type of augment does not seem to be possible. If I need to remove an augment for some reason, placing the gauntlet alone in a crafting grid will remove the most recently added augment.<BR> Sadly, I have been unable to get the original Caster's Gauntlet to support my augmentation system. The poor materials used in the gauntlet seem to be unable to handle the additional stress added to it by the augments. Oh well, it was just a prototype anyway.

thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone.title=Void Stone
thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone.0=<IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/blocks/void_stone.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG><BR>This dark-colored stone can be found in most locales around dimensional fractures. It easily binds to other pieces of itself, meaning it is able to be put back together after being broken. It is also noticeably softer than normal stone.
thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone.1=<IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/blocks/void_stone_soil_taint_side_0.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG><BR>This layer of taint appears on the surface of tainted areas in the void. Although it still sticks together relatively easily, it seems to be infused with some kind of ancient biological material - similar to the tainted things I have enountered before. Unlike "normal" tainted blocks, it is very stable and will not spread or decay over time.
thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone.2=<IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/blocks/void_stone_taint.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG><BR>This variant of Void Stone is found in the tainted lands of the void. Just like its soil counterpart, it will not decay or spread to nearby materials.

thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone_usage.title=Manufacturing Eldritch Stone
thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone_usage.0=One thing I haven't managed to confirm yet was the mention of a special type of stone in the Crimson Rites - one that was extremely durable and had magical properties that resemble those of Arcane Stone. Although it is lacking in details on its creation, it does mention combining a purple stone with magical crystals. This purple stone sounds eerily similar to the Void Stone I recently discovered - I need to investigate this for myself.
thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone_usage.1=For better or for worse, the Crimson Cult was right once again. I was able to transform a small piece of Void Stone into the stone described, which I will call Eldritch Stone. Just as the Rites described, this stone is able to withstand almost any explosion, and takes longer than usual to remove with pickaxes and other tools.

thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_power.title=Rift Power
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_power.0=Drawing power from rifts to make void seeds is useful in itself, but I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of the potential of rift energy. However, before I can find uses for this energy, I need to find a way to extract it into a usable form. 
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_power.1=Thanks to some research, I have determined that it should be possible to hold energy from rifts in a custom storage cell. This cell will need to have a heavilly modified void seed core, which acts as the receptor for the energy.<BR>I suppose I should give this energy a name. Because rift energy seems to be much more volatile than the Vis I've worked with before, I think a suitable name would be "Impetus" - force.<BR>Now all I need is a tool to extract the energy with. Instead of making a dedicated tool for this purpose, I'm confident that I can use my augment system to attach some sort of energy extractor to a casting gauntlet.
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_power.2=I have finally finished creating all I need to begin delving into the uses of Impetus. Not only can the device I created extract power from a rift, it is also capable of releasing it somewhat rapidly. To get started, I should attach the Impetus Conductor to a gauntlet. Then, I only need to stand close to a flux rift and it will slowly drain energy from the rift into the augment.<BR>As with the Void Siphon, drawing energy from the rift will cause it become more unstable, in addition to rapidly shrinking - eventually into nothing. If I don't want to constantly make new flux rifts, I should ensure the rift stays stable and has a healthy size.<BR>While I don't have any other devices that make use of Impetus at the moment, I have noticed a peculiar effect on the casting gauntlet itself. The presence of Impetus seems to slightly increase the power of any focus, without consuming any Impetus to do so. This seems to continue for as long as the attached Impetus Conductor contains at least some energy - the amount does not seem to matter.

thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward.title=Focus Effect: Ward
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward.0=Now that I have successfully warded individual objects, I think I should look into applying warding thaumaturgy to arbitrary materials in the world. While I doubt that any given material will be able to match the strength of dedicated warded blocks, any extra protection is worth investigating. I should experiment with some common means of destruction to get an idea of how far I can go with this.
research.f_STRONGPICKAXE.text=Any powerful mining tool
research.f_FLINTANDSTEEL.text=A tool that can create fire
research.m_CREEPER.text=A creature that has an explosive personality
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward.1=Surprisingly, my experiments went better than I expected - I have created a focus effect capable of warding any simple material placed in the world. "Simple materials" includes objects like stone and dirt that are inert and exhibit no special properties. Sadly, machines are rendered inoperable by the ward focus, with more complex machines failing to be warded at all.<BR>While I have done my best to protect against as many different methods of destruction as I could, I know I cannot protect against them all. Perhaps the simplest example of this is gravity - it seems it is too strong for my wards, and will still bring any blocks normally affected by it to the ground. However, I am certain that manual breaking, normal explosions, and fire damage are all accounted for.<BR>There are multiple ways to tell if something is warded using this focus effect - the easiest is to punch it. If energy seems to ripple from the impact, then it is surely warded. Holding any casting gauntlet with a warding focus equipped will allow me to directly observe the warding energies around blocks, giving them a shimmering effect in a small area around where I am looking. The color of this shimmering effect seems to be related to the caster - the particles will be green if I was the caster, but red if it was not me.<BR>To remove the ward on a block, I just need to recast the ward focus on it. In the event that a block is somehow destroyed even while warded, the protection of the ward will fade from that location.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward.2=Golems seem to ignore the presence of warded objects when going about their business. If I find that my golems are wandering aimlessly instead of doing their tasks, I should ensure that the blocks they are supposed to interact with are not warded.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward.3=It appears that the Arcane Bore's one-track clockwork mind is quite confused by the idea of warded blocks. If the next block it would mine is warded, the bore will unsuccessfully attempt to mine it forever. I should ensure the mining area is clear of warded blocks if I wish to use the Arcane Bore.

thaumicaugmentation.research.entering_fracture.title=Entering the Void
thaumicaugmentation.research.entering_fracture.0=I have been trying to determine if it would be possible to open a Flux Rift that doesn't lead to a swift death for quite a while now. While I think it isn't possible for me to open one myself, I have a theory that some may exist naturally in the world. However, these fractures in the fabric of reality can only occur in certain locations, where the boundries between dimensions are weaker than normal.<BR>To help me locate one of these places, I have drawn up plans for a device that should be able to point me towards one. By attuning a vacuous crystal with some rare earths, the crystal will react strongly to an excess of its own aspect - which just so happens to be that of the void. I also need to use a mundane material like brass for the outer casing, as using thaumium or void metal will probably make it too sensitive to get an accurate reading.<BR>Once crafted, the crystal in the device will glow if I am facing towards a fracture. The stronger the glow, the closer to the exact direction I am facing. Sadly, it appears that the Fracture Locator has a limited range. I don't have any precise measurements of exactly how far that may be, but some quick testing shows that its ability to trace the presence of vacuous drops sharply rougly at the distance where the ground meets the horizon.<BR>Whether I use the Fracture Locator or not, I should scan one of these dimensional fracture to determine my next steps.
research.m_DIMENSIONALFRACTURE.text=Find a dimensional fracture
thaumicaugmentation.research.entering_fracture.1=My theory of natural fractures existing has proven to be correct. While it was a crucial step to entering the void, there's one small problem. The fracture is not fully connected to the other side. Luckily, a burst of energy should be able to rip it open - which I now have the ability to create, in the form of Impetus.<BR>All I need to do use a casting gauntlet with an attached Impetus Conductor on the fracture, and it should shortly fully open. I have no idea what could be on the other side, although the ground around the fracture might give me some indication. Despite the possible danger, it's far too late for me to turn back now.
research.m_ENTERVOID.text=Find out what's on the other side
thaumicaugmentation.research.entering_fracture.2=While I was hoping for something a bit more interesting than a dark wasteland, I still think this place can be useful to me. There are many more fractures that are close together - they must lead to areas far away from each other, as even finding a single fracture before was not so easy. It also seems that many different dimensions can lead here. I might want to see if having an alternate entrance into any of them might be useful to me.<BR>While most of this place seems eerily quiet, I can see that the tainted areas are full of life. I should be careful when travelling through these areas, as taint can be incredibly dangerous.
thaumicaugmentation.research.entering_fracture.3=Because Eldritch Guardians are tasked with guarding the places where the boundries between dimensions are weakest, I have a feeling that they may not appreciate me opening dimensional fractures. I should be prepared to deal with unwelcome visitors around any fracture that I open.
