thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_thaumium.0=전에 언급했듯이, 철은 매우 좋지 않은 비스 전도체입니다. 작업을 좋아하지는 않지만, 사우뮴을 발견한 이상, 과거의 주문 건틀렛 프로토타입을 훨씬 더 효과적으로 강화하는 것은 간단한 작업일 것입니다.<BR>개선하는 동안, 가죽의 대체품으로서 마법의 직물의 유용성에 대하여 조사해봐야 할 것 같습니다.
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_thaumium.1=새로운 주문 건틀렛을 성공적으로 만들었으며, 이것을 (창의적이지는 못하게) 사우뮴 주문 건틀렛이라고 부르기로 했습니다. 사우뮴의 도입으로 인해 비스의 효율이 10% 더 좋아질 뿐만 아니라, 주문의 재사용 대기시간도 약간 감소했습니다.<BR>마법의 직물은 염색이 잘 되는 것 같습니다 - 평범한 작업대에 건틀렛과 하나 이상의 염료를 조합하기만 하면 색을 입힐 수 있습니다. 염료를 제거하려면, 물이 꽉 찬 평범한 가마솥에 건틀렛을 사용하면 됩니다.

thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_void.title=공허 선견자의 주문 건틀렛
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_void.0=While the thaumium casting gauntlet was certainly a success, I can't help but wonder if void metal is as effective a vis conductor as thaumium is. Even if it isn't, I have trouble believing its morphic properties won't have some benefit. 
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_void.1=My results so far have been surprisingly disappointing. I have seen a small reduction in the vis cost of casting, but not enough to outweigh thaumium's faster recharge abilities.<BR>Perhaps I have been looking at the wrong component to improve...
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_void.2=It seems my previous conjecture has proven to be correct. Upon replacing the vis resonator with a voidseer's pearl, the gauntlet felt much more connected to the surronding aura. So connected, in fact, that not only have I measured a 30% vis discount over my original prototype, but it also absorbs vis over a much wider area. Hopefully this will mean I can cast with very complex foci without depleting the local aura nearly as quickly as before.<BR>It seems that while the cooldown time of this gauntlet is still better than the original caster, the thaumium gauntlet is still superior in this regard. I will have to decide which trait, vis usage or cooldown time, I find more valuable. Luckilly, the ability to dye the gauntlet was retained from its predecessor. The method to apply and remove dye is the same as for the thaumium gauntlet.

thaumicaugmentation.research.vis_regenerator.1=비스 재생성기라고 하는 장치에 대한 설계를 완료했습니다. 실버우드 잎과 에센시아 필터로 만들어진 격자층으로 구성되어 있으며, 격자 사이로 오라를 "재순환"하려는 외부 케이스로 만들어졌습니다.<BR>이 장치의 흥미로운 점은 효율이 그 지역의 오라의 총 용량과 관련이 있는 것처럼 보인다는 것입니다. 즉, 자연적으로 오라가 적은 지역은 더 높은 재생률을 기대할 수 있습니다.<BR>어떤 이유로든간에 비스 재생성기를 비활성화해야 하는 경우 레드스톤 신호를 주면 됩니다.

thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_copier.0=골렘의 인장을 수작업으로 설정하는 것은 소규모 프로젝트에 적합하지만, 다량의 인장이 연루되면 지루해지며 실수를 만들기도 쉽습니다. 많은 양의 인장을 신속하게 설정할 수 있는 방법을 연구해야 합니다.
thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_copier.1=기본적인 인장 복사 장치에 대한 계획을 세웠습니다. 필요한 설정으로 인장 하나를 구성한 다음 복사기로 우클릭하면 됩니다. 그 다음에는 설정을 적용할 다른 모든 인장을 우클릭하면 됩니다. 복사기에 기억된 정보를 지우려면 쉬프트 우클릭해야 합니다. 그러면 새 설정을 복사할 수 있습니다.<BR>인장 복사기는 주인의 것이 아닌 인장과 상호작용할 수 없는 것 같습니다. 다른 마도학자들과 함께 일한다면 이 점을 명심해야 합니다.

thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_secure.title=행동의 인장: 경비
thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_secure.0=골렘이 특정 영역을 보호하도록 하는 인장은 이미 만들었지만, 이것이 전투 골렘으로 가능한 모든 것을 해결할 수 있다곤 생각하지 않습니다. 보호의 인장이 사용하는 법칙을 작은 지역에 사용하는 대신, 골렘들을 부추겨 그들의 시야 내의 모든 몬스터들을 공격하게 적용하는 것은 사소한 작업일 것입니다.
thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_secure.1=매우 간단한 수정 후, 보호의 인장은 경비의 인장이 되었습니다. 이 행동의 인장은 적절한 전투 능력이 있는 모든 골렘들을 자극하여 좁은 지역의 위협과는 반대로 시야 내의 활동 범위에의 모든 위협들을 공격하게 할 것입니다. 대부분의 다른 인장과는 달리 경비의 인장에는 설정 가능한 범위가 없습니다. 대신 주변의 골렘들이 고정된 범위(하지만 훨씬 더 넓은) 내에 침입하는 피조물들을 공격합니다. 하지만, 이것은 골렘이 그들이 공격해서는 안 되는 것도 공격하게 하지 않도록 각별히 주의해야 한다는 것을 의미합니다. 그런 실수의 결과는 매우 실망스러울 것이기 때문입니다.
thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_secure.2=이제 이 인장의 고급 형태를 만들 수 있습니다. 이 고급 형태를 사용하면 자연마법 정신을 갖춘 골렘들이 무엇을 공격하게 할 지, 그리고 시야에 들어오는 목표에만 신경쓸지에 대한 제어를 할 수 있습니다.

thaumicaugmentation.research.more_auromancy.title=Further Auromancy Studies
thaumicaugmentation.research.more_auromancy.0=I have already discovered quite a few elemental foci effects, but I feel there is still much more to discover. There are so many aspects of essentia I have not experimented with that I am bound to find something useful.

thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_light.title=포커스 효과: 빛
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_light.0=While fire does give off light, it can be a bit... destructive. It should be somewhat simple to create an effect completely dedicated to giving off light. To begin, I should examine some light sources I already have access to.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_light.1=The light pattern does exactly what I was hoping - it creates a bright light source wherever it is used. The light source will even be able to last forever - meaning I can use it for permanent lighting if I wish.<BR>I do wonder what would happen if a living creature was exposed to this pattern's blast of light.

thaumicaugmentation.research.warded_arcana.title=결계 마법
thaumicaugmentation.research.warded_arcana.0=While browsing some of the old manuscripts in the Thaumonomicon, I came across a section that described the applications of warding arcana. Being able to create objects that are protected against everything except its owner sounds like something I should investigate. I should begin my studies by examining the warded device I have already created, the Warded Jar.
thaumicaugmentation.research.warded_arcana.1=My examination of the Warded Jar provided me with all I need to know - it should be possible to apply protective properties to almost all materials, so long as I apply a special rune to the object first. While I'm excited by the possibilities this can lead to, I think it would be best to start with something simple - like a chest.
thaumicaugmentation.research.warded_arcana.2=By taking a mundane chest and applying a warding sigil, I have created a container that is not only almost invoidable to all outside forces, but is also only accessible to me. This means I cannot use neither traditional methods of extracting and inserting items, such as hoppers, nor golems - maybe this is something I can look into in the future.<BR>Should I want to remove the chest, I need to sneak and then use any casting gauntlet on it.

thaumicaugmentation.research.arcane_door.title=아케인 문
thaumicaugmentation.research.arcane_door.0=Now that I have mastered the basics of warding objects, I think I can move on to something a bit more advanced. The original manuscripts I read described an indestructable door, which sounds like something worth researching. After all, replacing doors broken down by zombies does get annoying after a while...
thaumicaugmentation.research.arcane_door.1=I have managed to create the warded door described in the manuscript, which I am calling the Arcane Door. Just like the Warded Chest, the doors will only open for their owner, and are extremely difficult to remove by normal means. I have also made three different styles - greatwood, silverwood, and thaumium. They are all functionally the same, but it is nice to have options for decoration purposes.<BR>If I want to remove the door, I need to sneak and then use the bottom half of it with any casting gauntlet.<BR>It seems that these doors are "smart" in the sense that two doors placed next to each other act as double doors and will open and close together. How convenient.<BR>I have also created trapdoor forms of these doors. They work in the same way as the normal doors, just in a smaller profile.

thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_keys.title=접근권 제어
thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_keys.0=Being able to have private objects is nice and all, but sometimes I need to share my belongings with fellow Thaumaturges. I should devise a way to selectively grant access to those I want to permit.
thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_keys.1=I have created objects to allow others to access arbitrary warded objects - keys. But these are not any ordinary keys, as they will learn to emulate the person they are bound to. This seems sufficient to bypass the protections of the wards, provided the bound person matches with the object. Each key works slightly differently - I have written instructions for each type of key on the following pages, should I need to reference them.<PAGE>Iron Key<DIV><IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/items/key_iron.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG>These are the simplest of the three types of keys. To bind one to my warded objects, I need to use it on empty space (it does not need to be used on any block). It will then allow anyone possessing the key access. To unbind the key, I should use the key while sneaking.<PAGE>Brass Key<DIV><IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/items/key_brass.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG>This key functions in a similar way to the iron key - use to bind, sneak while using to unbind. However, the brass key has the ability to copy its binding to an iron key. To do this, one needs to place both the brass key and an unbound iron key in a mundane crafting grid. The brass key will not be consumed by this process. Copying thaumium keys will be described in the following section. <PAGE>Thaumium Key<DIV><IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/items/key_thaumium.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG>The thaumium key is interesting in that it does not only bind to beings - it also binds to the object and its location. In other words, this key will permit to access to a single warded object at a location. To bind this key, I need to use it on the warded object I want to bind it to. This binding will still be valid even if I remove and replace the object at a location, but only if it still matches the type of object the key was originally bound to. Sneaking while using the key will unbind it, like the others. To copy a Thaumium key, I need to combine it in a mundane crafting grid with an empty Thaumium key and a brass key bound to the same person as the thaumium key.

thaumicaugmentation.research.boots_void.title=공허 마도학자의 신발
thaumicaugmentation.research.boots_void.0=With void metal allowing me to upgrade most of my existing armour to take advantage of its superior capabilities, it only makes sense for me to try to apply this material to the Boots of the Traveller as well.
thaumicaugmentation.research.boots_void.1=I have succeeded in upgrading the Boots of the Traveller into a superior form I am calling the Void Thaumaturge Boots. These boots have the expected boosts to speed and jump height over the original (at the cost of slightly increased vis consumption), as well as the auto-repair capabilities of all void metal items. Most notably, fall damage is greatly reduced beyond the jump height of these boots - I can practically fall into a ravine and walk away unharmed.<BR>These boots are also now dyeable. I simply need to craft them with the dye(s) I want to color them, or use them on a filled, mundane cauldron to wash away the dye.

thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_studies.title=Rift Studies
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_studies.0=I think that flux rifts are much more important to my studies than they may seem. When they are created from an excess of flux, they open and connect to the void. I'm sure that they contain the secret to opening rifts into places that are more... hospitable.<BR>However, studying flux rifts currently requires me to saturate the aura with flux. It might be beneficial to contain all the flux I need into a small "seed" that can then be released into the target area, rather than having to resort to more messy alternatives. I should look into ways to compress a large amount of flux into a small space.
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_studies.1=By concentrating a large amount of Vitium essentia into a void seed, the flux created will shortly be absorbed into the aura and almost certaintly create a rift. I should be very careful with these flux seeds - "planting" them will instantly release all of its contained flux, consuming the seed.<BR>It seems that limiting the essentia in the seed to strictly Vitium allows more flux to be created per unit of essentia than just dumping it into the aura. If I want to take advantage of this to create larger rifts, I should be able to infuse even more Vitium into the smaller flux seed. However, not only does the instability in the infusion increase with the amount of Vitium added, but I only seem to be able to safely use this process once on any given flux seed.

thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_augmentation.title=증강 장치
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_augmentation.0=사우뮴 건틀렛과 같은 개선된 주문 건틀렛을 만드는 것은 훌륭하지만, 언젠가는 새로운 건틀렛의 디자인을 생각해 낼 수 없을 것입니다. 어쩌면 이미 가지고 있는 디자인을 더 개선하는 방법 쪽으로 생각해볼 시간을 가져봐야 할지도 모릅니다. 또한 이는 새로운 발전을 할 때마다 새로운 건틀렛으로 교체할 필요가 없는 모듈화된 시스템을 고안해 낼 기회입니다.
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_augmentation.1=주문 시전을 보다 효과적으로 하기 위한 시스템의 초안을 생각해냈습니다. 첫번째 구성요소로 필요한 것은 주문이 사용할 추가 에너지를 생성하는 일종의 "수식어"입니다. 하지만, 이 추가 에너지를 실제로 사용하기 위해선 일종의 필터가 필요할 것입니다 - 이것은 포커스와 비슷한 방법으로 만들 수 있을 것이라고 믿습니다. 이것들은 기존 건틀렛의 메커니즘에 추가되는 것이기 때문에, 이 새로운 유형의 장치를 "증강 장치"라고 부르기로 했습니다.<BR>에너지 공급원으로부터 이러한 효과 결정들에 다양한 "수식어"를 적용할 수 있기를 원하지만, 지금은 간단한 것부터 시작해봐야 합니다. 지금까지 내가 만든 주문 건틀렛들은 모두 오라와 접하기 위해 비스 공명장치를 사용합니다. 아마도 에센시아의 전체 스펙트럼 대신에, 특정 측면에만 특화된 유형의 공명장치를 만들 수 있을 것입니다.<BR>이 새로운 원소 공명 보정 장치는 건틀렛이 에센시아의 한 원소를 보다 효율적으로 사용할 수 있게 하여 같은 원소의 모든 포커스 효과들을 보다 효율적으로 만들 것입니다. 내가 사용하기로 결정한 포커싱 크리스탈에 따라, 포커스 힘, 시전 속도 또는 비스 효율의 세가지 특성 중 하나에 영향을 줄 수 있습니다. 하지만, 그 원소를 "증폭"하는 방식 때문에, 이 과정은 건틀렛당 하나의 원소에만 가능합니다. 그럼에도 불구하고, 모듈식 증강장치를 만들었다는 것과 이 증강 시스템이 실제로 얼마나 효과적인지를 보게 되어 흥분됩니다.<BR>이 증강장치를 실제로 구축하기 위해선 원소 보정 장치("수식어" 역할을 함)를 제작하여 조합 창에서 아무 효과 결정과 결합해야 합니다. 슬프게도, 한 번 결합되면 다시 분리하는 것은 불가능합니다. 현재 계획에선 Ordo 결정과 힘의 효과 결정을 결합하는 것을 예로 들 수 있지만, 어떤 원소나 특성을 더 강력하게 만들고 싶은가에 따라서, 어떤 비스 크리스탈과 효과 크리스탈의 조합도 사용 가능할 것입니다.
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_augmentation.2=생각한 대로, 공명 장치를 문제없이 만들 수 있었습니다. 다만 한 가지 예상하지 못한 문제라면, 한 가지 원소에는 호의적인 반응을 하는 반면 다른 하나 이상의 원소들에는 부정적인 반응을 한다는 점입니다. 원소에 따라서 어떤 원소에 영향이 있는지가 달리지는 것 같습니다. 사용하고자 하는 포커스가 부정적인 영향을 받지 않도록 하기 위해선 원소의 실험이 필요할 것 같습니다.<BR>원소 보정 장치 (또는 완성된 아무 증강 장치)를 조합 창에 올리는 것으로 내부 결정을 교체할 수 있습니다. 사용했던 예전 결정들을 되찾을 수 있겠군요.<BR>증강 시스템 자체에 대해서는, 상당히 모듈화된 설계를 했습니다. 전에도 언급했지만, 각각의 증강은 수식어(원소 보정 장치같은)와 효과(포커스 힘, 시전 속도, 비스 효율)로 구성되며, 평범한 조합 창에서 결합됩니다. 장치에 증강 장치를 적용하려면, 아무 조합 창에 아이템 (주로 주문 건틀렛)과 함께 배치하기만 하면 됩니다. 이러한 주문 건틀렛은 적어도 3가지 증강 장치를 문제없이 지원할 것 같이 보이지만, 동일한 유형의 수식어(다른 원소를 사용하는 원소 보정 장치 포함)를 가진 복수의 증강 장치를 결합하는 것은 불가능해 보입니다. 어떤 이유로 증강 장치를 제거해야 하는 경우, 건틀렛을 조합 창에 두면 가장 최근에 추가된 증강 장치부터 제거됩니다. 추가와 제거는 무제한입니다.<BR>슬프게도, 예전의 그 원본 주문 건틀렛은 증강 시스템을 지원하지 않습니다. 건틀렛에 사용된 부실한 재료들은 증강 장치에 의해 더해지는 부하를 감당하지 못하는 것 같습니다. 근데 그건 어쨌든 그냥 프로토타입이었으니까요.

thaumicaugmentation.research.dimensional_modifiers.title=Dimensional Modifiers
thaumicaugmentation.research.dimensional_modifiers.0=While the Elemental Modifier was able to increase the effectiveness of casting by reacting to the focus' aspect, an internal stimuli, I should be able to make modifiers that react to external stimuli as well. The simplest of these would be the mundane materials that make up the dimensions I can visit. I should study some samples of materials from each of these places to find out if I can use them for this purpose, and find a way to make the augment improve focus casting whilst I am in the dimensions which these materials originate from.
thaumicaugmentation.research.dimensional_modifiers.1=I have created three different dimensional modifiers, each one reacting positively from being in the Overworld, the Nether, or the End, respectively. The modifier itself works by using a crystalline structure that resonates when it is brought into the dimension it is linked to, with this linking process being achieved by using resources that come from a certain dimension to create the crystal. While all of these dimensional modifiers will give a benefit, it seems like the modifier for the Nether is stronger than the Overworld's modifier, and the End's modifier is stronger than both. I'm not quite sure why this is the case, especially considering how the latter dimensions generally have lower Vis levels than the Overworld, but I may be able to discover this with further research in the future. Something else may very well be at play here.

thaumicaugmentation.research.emptiness_modifier.title=수식어: 공허
thaumicaugmentation.research.emptiness_modifier.0=Now that I have visited the Emptiness, I should be able to create a dimensional modifier that makes focus casting more powerful there, in the same manner as I did for the three comparatively mundane dimensions I have created modifiers for so far.
thaumicaugmentation.research.emptiness_modifier.1=With my experience from creating the previous dimensional modifiers, making one for the Emptiness was an easy task. I simply needed to apply the previous principles of dimensional modifier creation, but instead using Emptiness-specific resources for my research and the inevitable augment modifier creation. This modifier also appears to be as powerful as the End's modifier, so that is a pleasant surprise. I do find it an odd coincidence that the most powerful dimensional modifiers are related to dimensions that are more akin to void worlds, with both the End and the Emptiness being mostly barren floating islands in a starry void. In fact, it may not be a coincidence at all. I fear that the eldritch energies in these dimensions (visible in the quantities of Alienis, Vacuos, and Tenebrae in the materials of these worlds) may be having an effect on the aura. I am unsure of the long-term consequences this may have, but it is almost certainly something I will have to monitor in the future.

thaumicaugmentation.research.frenzy_modifier.title=수식어: Frenzy
thaumicaugmentation.research.frenzy_modifier.0=Most of my efforts in researching and experimenting with augment modifiers have been focused on passive effects. It may be prudent to try to come up with a system to actively increase my casting abilities while I am using it.<BR>Normally, the flow of Vis through the gauntlet must be regulated to a slow rate, or the device will simply not work. If I am using this Vis frequently enough, it should be possible to slowly increase this limit whilst using the gauntlet. The main problem with this is that precisely monitoring such small differences in Vis usage is not the easiest thing to do, especially with the equipment available to me. But what if there was another way to indirectly measure my Vis usage?<BR>I have considered one way to possibly make this work - during my recent studies in Golemancy, I have created the aggression module, which incites golems to attack other creatures. If I can somehow measure a reaction in the module when damaging something through focus casting, I might be able to use it as a signal to speed up the flow of Vis throughout the gauntlet. I should give my theory a try, but I doubt this will work like I am hoping it will.
thaumicaugmentation.research.frenzy_modifier.1=Surprisingly, my idea to make the aggression module regulate the flow of Vis was a success. The aggression module, with some minor adjustments, is able to detect damage done to creatures through focus casting, and will output a measurable signal accordingly. The Frenzy module, as I have come to call it, will thus gradually improve the flow of Vis through the gauntlet and its connected focus. To put it simply, if I continue to deal damage to a monster or any other creature within a relatively short time frame, my casting will gradually become more and more powerful. If I holster my caster or don't damage anything for a period of time, the flow of Vis will immediately reset to its natural level.

thaumicaugmentation.research.experience_modifier.title=수식어: Experience
thaumicaugmentation.research.experience_modifier.0=While I had made use of the knowledge buried inside experience orbs in devices such as the Headband of Curiosity, I feel I may be able to make use of the knowledge contained within these orbs to better focus the magical energies involved in spell casting. Knowledge is inherently related to Auromancy, as a wiser Thaumaturge is better able to manipulate the Aura, since they have a better understanding of its flow and of the ways to manipulate it to their advantage. Through application of experience levels I may yet find another means of improving my spell casting abilities.
thaumicaugmentation.research.experience_modifier.1=Knowledge of the Aura gained through research naturally improves one's ability to use it. So it is only logical that the experience gained through simply living one's life, whether from ordinary activities or more esoteric ones, can also enhance one's Auromancy abilities. In this case, I have managed to create an augment modifier that improves the flow of Vis based on how many experience levels I have gained. I should be able to see a benefit even with low amounts of experience, albeit a small one. It will take me quite a lot of experience to fully utilize this modifier's capabilities - I do suppose that wisdom does not lend itself easily to the inexperienced.

thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone.0=<IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/blocks/void_stone.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG><BR>This dark-colored stone can be found in most locales around dimensional fractures. It easily binds to other pieces of itself, meaning it is able to be put back together after being broken. It is also noticeably softer than normal stone.
thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone.1=<IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/blocks/void_stone_soil_taint_side_0.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG><BR>This layer of taint appears on the surface of tainted areas in the Emptiness. Although it still sticks together relatively easily, it seems to be infused with some kind of ancient biological material - similar to the tainted things I have enountered before. Unlike "normal" tainted blocks, it is very stable and will not spread or decay over time.
thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone.2=<IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/blocks/void_stone_taint.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG><BR>This variant of Void Stone is found in the tainted lands of the Emptiness. Just like its soil counterpart, it will not decay or spread to nearby materials.

thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone_usage.title=엘드리치 돌 제조
thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone_usage.0=One thing I haven't managed to confirm yet was the mention of a special type of stone in the Crimson Rites - one that was extremely durable and had magical properties that resemble those of Arcane Stone. Although it is lacking in details on its creation, it does mention combining a purple stone with eldritch energy. This purple stone sounds eerily similar to the Void Stone I recently discovered - I need to investigate this for myself.
thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone_usage.1=For better or for worse, the Crimson Cult was right once again. I was able to transform a small piece of Void Stone into the stone described, which I will call Eldritch Stone. Just as the Rites described, this stone is able to withstand almost any explosion, and takes longer than usual to remove with pickaxes and other tools.

thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_power.title=Rift Power
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_power.0=Drawing power from rifts to make void seeds is useful in itself, but I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of the potential of rift energy. However, before I can find uses for this energy, I need to find a way to extract it into a usable form. 
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_power.1=Thanks to some research, I have determined that it should be possible to hold energy from rifts in a custom storage cell. This cell will need to have a heavilly modified void seed core, which acts as the receptor for the energy.<BR>I suppose I should give this energy a name. Because rift energy seems to be much more volatile than the Vis I've worked with before, I think a suitable name would be "Impetus" - force.<BR>Now all I need is a tool to extract the energy with. Instead of making a dedicated tool for this purpose, I'm confident that I can use my augment system to attach some sort of energy extractor to a casting gauntlet.
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_power.2=I have finally finished creating all I need to begin delving into the uses of Impetus. Not only can the device I created extract power from a rift, it is also capable of releasing it somewhat rapidly. To get started, I should attach the Impetus Conductor to a gauntlet. Then, I only need to stand close to a flux rift and it will slowly drain energy from the rift into the augment.<BR>As with the Void Siphon, drawing energy from the rift will cause it become more unstable, in addition to rapidly shrinking - eventually into nothing. If I don't want to constantly make new flux rifts, I should ensure the rift stays stable and has a healthy size.<BR>While I don't have any other devices that make use of Impetus at the moment, I have noticed a peculiar effect on the casting gauntlet itself. The presence of Impetus seems to slightly increase the power of any focus, without consuming any Impetus to do so. This seems to continue for as long as the attached Impetus Conductor contains at least some energy - the amount does not seem to matter.

thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_coremod.title=포커스 효과: 결계
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_coremod.0=Now that I have successfully warded individual objects, I think I should look into applying warding thaumaturgy to arbitrary materials in the world. While I doubt that any given material will be able to match the strength of dedicated warded blocks, any extra protection is worth investigating. I should experiment with some common means of destruction to get an idea of how far I can go with this.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_coremod.1=Surprisingly, my experiments went better than I expected - I have created a focus effect capable of warding any simple material placed in the world. "Simple materials" includes objects like stone and dirt that are inert and exhibit no special properties. Sadly, machines are rendered frozen in time by the ward focus, meaning that objects like redstone mechanisms will not work properly while warded. More complex machines will fail to be warded at all.<BR>While I have done my best to protect against as many different methods of destruction as I could, I know I cannot protect against them all. Despite this, I am certain that warded blocks should be immune to manual breaking, normal explosions, fire damage, piston movement and even the effect of gravity on blocks such as gravel or sand.<BR>There are multiple ways to tell if something is warded using this focus effect - the easiest is to punch it. If energy seems to ripple from the impact, then it is surely warded. Holding any casting gauntlet with a warding focus equipped will allow me to directly observe the warding energies around blocks, giving them a shimmering effect in a small area around where I am looking. The color of this shimmering effect seems to be related to the caster - the particles will be green if I was the caster, but red if it was not me.<BR>To remove the ward on a block, I just need to recast the ward focus on it. In the event that a block is somehow destroyed even while warded, the protection of the ward will fade from that location.<BR>Lastly, I should be careful with what I choose to ward. While experimenting with different objects can be fun, I'm still dealing with an uncharted area of thaumaturgy. I can't be sure that every block will still work perfectly.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_coremod.2=Golems seem to ignore the presence of warded objects when going about their business. If I find that my golems are wandering aimlessly instead of doing their tasks, I should ensure that the blocks they are supposed to interact with are not warded.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_coremod.3=The Arcane Bore seems to be intelligent enough to ignore warded blocks and instead mine whatever it can. However, warded blocks will prevent it from mining any blocks behind them. I should ensure the mining area is clear of warded blocks if I wish to use the Arcane Bore.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_coremod.4=The rift focus effect should fail to work on any warded blocks. This means I should be able to deny access to an area, even if there are other Thaumaturges around who have discovered such dimensional magic.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_coremod.5=I have ensured that the exchange focus effect should not work on warded blocks. Any attempt to exchange a warded block for another will fail entirely, much like when trying to exchange any other kind of indestructible block. Thus, even if there are other practitioners of Thaumaturgy in the area, my warded areas should remain safe and secure.

thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_no_coremod.3=It appears that the Arcane Bore's one-track clockwork mind is quite confused by the idea of warded blocks. If the next block it would mine is warded, the bore will unsuccessfully attempt to mine it forever. I should ensure the mining area is clear of warded blocks if I wish to use the Arcane Bore.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_no_coremod.4=As the rift focus effect just moves blocks somewhere else, and doesn't otherwise damage them, those rifts will be able to be created on warded blocks. I should keep this in mind if I am trying to deny access to an area and there are other Thaumaturges around.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_no_coremod.5=As the exchange focus effect simply replaces one type of block for another by swapping their position, warded blocks can still be exchanged. However, the ward should at least remain on the exchanged blocks, but I should still take care if there are other practitioners of Thaumaturgy in the area.

thaumicaugmentation.research.fracture_theory.title=공허의 발견
thaumicaugmentation.research.fracture_theory.0=I have been trying to determine if it would be possible to open a Flux Rift that doesn't lead to a swift death for quite a while now. While I think it isn't possible for me to open one myself, I have a theory that some may exist naturally in the world. However, these fractures in the fabric of reality can only occur in certain locations, where the boundries between dimensions are weaker than normal. I should create a device that can help me locate one of these places.
thaumicaugmentation.research.fracture_theory.1=I have drawn up plans for a device that should be able to point me towards a dimensional fracture. By attuning a vacuous crystal with some rare earths, the crystal will react strongly to an excess of its own aspect - which just so happens to be that of the void. I also need to use a mundane material like brass for the outer casing, as using thaumium or void metal will probably make it too sensitive to get an accurate reading.<BR>Once crafted, the crystal in the device will glow if I am facing towards a fracture. The stronger the glow, the closer to the exact direction I am facing. Sadly, it appears that the Fracture Locator has a limited range. I don't have any precise measurements of exactly how far that may be, but some quick testing shows that its ability to trace the presence of vacuous drops sharply rougly at the distance where the ground meets the horizon.<BR>My calculations seem to show that space is greatly compressed in whatever place these fractures lead to, in a similar way to the Nether. Perhaps I should check there if I am having any trouble finding a fracture.

thaumicaugmentation.research.entering_fracture.title=공허 속으로
thaumicaugmentation.research.entering_fracture.0=Now that I am fairly certain dimensional fractures exist and lead somewhere, I should find and scan one of them to determine my next steps.
research.m_DIMENSIONALFRACTURE.text=Find a dimensional fracture
thaumicaugmentation.research.entering_fracture.1=My theory of natural fractures existing has proven to be correct. While it was a crucial step to entering the emptiness that lies beyond the fractures, there's one small problem. The fracture is not fully connected to the other side. Luckily, a burst of energy should be able to rip it open - which I now have the ability to create, in the form of Impetus.<BR>All I need to do is use a casting gauntlet with an attached and charged Impetus Conductor on the fracture, and after a few moments it should fully open. I have no idea what could be on the other side, although the ground around the fracture might give me some indication. Despite the possible danger, it's far too late for me to turn back now.
research.m_ENTERVOID.text=Find out what's on the other side
thaumicaugmentation.research.entering_fracture.2=While I was hoping for something a bit more interesting than a dark wasteland, I still think this place can be useful to me. There are many more fractures that are close together - they must lead to areas far away from each other, as even finding a single fracture before was not so easy. It also seems that many different dimensions can lead here. I might want to see if having an alternate entrance into any of them might be useful to me.<BR>If I want to open any more fractures in the future, I only need to repeat what I first did to get here - use a casting gauntlet with an attached (and charged) Impetus Conductor on the fracture and wait a few seconds.<BR>While most of this place seems eerily quiet, I can see that the tainted areas are full of life. I should be careful when travelling through these areas, as taint can be incredibly dangerous.
thaumicaugmentation.research.entering_fracture.3=Because Eldritch Guardians are tasked with guarding the places where the boundries between dimensions are weakest, I have a feeling that they may not appreciate me opening dimensional fractures. I should be prepared to deal with unwelcome visitors around any fracture that I open.

thaumicaugmentation.research.morphic_tool.title=변이된 도구
thaumicaugmentation.research.morphic_tool.0=As I continue making innovations in the world of Thaumaturgy, I find myself creating increasingly superior equipment. At the same time, while my old equipment may not match these new innovations in effectiveness, I may find their appearance to be more suitable for my personal tastes. I shouldn't have to compromise between potency and vanity - I should attempt to discover a way to create a tool that can have the appearance of one item, but the other properties, both magical and mundane, of another. Perhaps I can expand upon the Primal Crusher's unique metaphysical properties for this purpose.
thaumicaugmentation.research.morphic_tool.1=I have created a method of effectively combining two items into the same space. With the help of a Primordial Pearl and a small amount of Vacuos, I can allow two items to exist in the same space, while only one is visible to outside observers. The other item is where this new Morphic Tool derives its other properties, such as strength and durability. While in this state, the decorative item is held in a state of suspension, meaning that while it cannot be damaged, it cannot interact with the world in any way.<BR>To create one of these tools, I need to set up an infusion with the item I want to keep the physical properties of in the center, and place the decorative item on an outer pedestal (with the other requisite items of course). If I ever want to separate these two items, I only need to place the tool into a crafting grid - it seems like separating the items from each other requires substantially less energy than morphing them together.<BR>As I mentioned before, the functional item is still at risk of breaking while metaphysically bound to the decorative tool. While combined, it cannot be repaired through traditional methods. However, materials such as Void Metal will still keep their regenerative properties. I am also certain that certain more complex items will not work properly while in a Morphic Tool - while basic tools and both regular and infusion-based enchantments seem to behave, items such as armour do not.<BR>Lastly, the Morphic Tool seems to provide a slight insulating effect against warp created by the functional item. Perhaps I should revisit this phenomenon in the future to determine if I can make it more effective.

thaumicaugmentation.research.morphic_armor.title=변이된 방어구
thaumicaugmentation.research.morphic_armor.0=The Morphic Tool I previously created was a great success. Not only was it a breakthrough in applying the morphic properties of Primordial Pearls and Vacuos, but it also gave a purpose to my old, inferior equipment. Despite this advancement, there is still one major category of items I have not been able to use this process for - armour. I remember noting that it was too complex to keep multiple pieces of armour within the same space, without having one or both of them be disintegrated by the interdimensional forces holding them together, which I would rather not experience from the perspective of one wearing the armour. However, if I tighten the assumptions of what items are combined, then I might just be able to keep it stable enough. Making armour look like a sword is too much for it to handle, but what about two pieces of armour?
thaumicaugmentation.research.morphic_armor.1=I will admit, I am somewhat surprised at my success. I knew that reducing the disparities between the states the morphic item takes would make it more stable, but I underestimated how much of a difference it actually makes. I feel as if I can say that this new Morphic Armour will allow me to safely have a set of armour be displayed to the world, while in reality wearing a different set.<BR>The process for creating Morphic Armour is very similar to that of the Morphic Tool. The central item in the infusion is the piece of armour I want to keep the properties of, while the wearable item on the outside will become the outward appearance. Beyond than this, however, there a few key differences. The infusion also takes much more Vacuos, due to needing to control a larger space (hopefully without it collapsing in on me). This also makes the infusion much more unstable.<BR>Of course, I had to make some concessions to have this work at all. While the outward appearance of any given set of Morphic Armour will work largely as designed, a few physical properties from the functional armour 'leak' into it. Unlike the Morphic Tool, I will still be able to enchant and repair the armour in its morphic state, which will be applied as normal to the functional armour. This also means that should the armour break, I will lose the decorative portion as well. I should keep a watchful eye on its durability to ensure I don't lose more items than I need to. The process of separating the items from each other, via placing the armour in an empty crafting grid, still works with the Morphic Armour. This may be a good last resort, should my armour about to break.<BR>Lastly, the warp-insulating effect of the Morphic Tool has not carried over into the Morphic Armour. This is unfortunate, given that some armour sets can contribute a considerable amount of warp, but given the propagation of other physical properties from the functional armour, this is not a huge surprise.

thaumicaugmentation.research.primal_cutter.title=태고의 절단기
thaumicaugmentation.research.primal_cutter.0=The Primal Crusher has proven itself to be a particularly useful tool, with it essentially being four tools near-simultaneously. Unfortunately, the Crusher itself is still limited in certain areas, namely for use as a weapon, as it is rather bulky and it takes time for me to raise it back up in between swings. Even then, it is a fairly blunt instrument. However, it should be feasible for me to apply the principle of morphic instability to a different set of tools... say, a set of cutting implements?
thaumicaugmentation.research.primal_cutter.1=My theory holds true, and I have prepared a new weapon: the Primal Cutter. Like its predecessor, it is actually four morphically unstable tools all fluctuating between each other so fast that they act like one implement.<BR>The main difference between this tool and the Primal Crusher is what tools have been used in its construction, with the Cutter acting very much like both an axe and a sword. It is much lighter than the Primal Crusher, and I can swing it very fast, allowing me to deal powerful cutting strikes against my foes.<BR>This weapon kept not only the Arcing ability of the Sword of the Zephyr and the Burrowing enchantment of the Axe of the Stream, but also two more unique abilities. The simpler of the two is a powerful sapping ability - stronger than that of the Void Metal Sword. The more interesting trait gained by the Primal Cutter is the ability to draw items and creatures closer to me by continuously using the weapon. While I can think of quite a few uses for this new ability, I must also be careful - drawn entities can move quite quickly towards me, and extra durability will be consumed from the weapon while this effect is being used.<BR>By placing the weapon in a crafting grid, this drawing ability can be toggled. This can be useful if I wish to use another tool or item in my offhand.<BR>Despite their drastically different capabilities, the Primal Cutter still shares some properties with the Primal Crusher. In addition to constantly regenerating like all Void Metal materials, it has also received the Primal Crusher's disquieting nature when held for long periods, trembling in one's hand as the Void Metal morphs in between shapes imperceptibly. This will not discourage me from using it though, as it is far too useful a weapon to simply forget about.<BR>And I will not forget about it.

thaumicaugmentation.research.harness_base.title=자가 비행
thaumicaugmentation.research.harness_base.0=To freely soar through the skies is something many wish they could do, and while it is technically possible for anyone to fly directly downward after jumping off a cliff, it might be a better idea to be able to fly in the other five directions as well. I do appreciate having intact legs, after all.<BR>While I have not made much progress in utilising Thaumaturgy to induce flight in any mobile form, there are still some things I can do in the meantime. I know I will need a wearable item to attach the flying mechanisms to, unless I want my hypothetical creation to shoot off into the stratosphere without me.
thaumicaugmentation.research.harness_base.1=I have designed a simple and relatively comfortable harness, with many buckles, straps, and connectors specifically aimed to allow the attachment of different arcane mechanisms and components. There is no point in wearing it in its current form, however, as it is simply a blank canvas for any flying devices to be built upon.<BR>With some further research, I can only imagine what different means of flight may be possible. I should take caution however, lest I become a faintly Thaumaturge-shaped crater at the bottom of a valley somewhere.

thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_harness.title=사우모스태틱 하네스
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_harness.0=My recent invention of the Arcane Levitator has provided me with a very limited type of levitation-based flight, but ever since I completed that design I have wondered whether it would be possible to apply similar principles to a portable device that allows me to freely levitate wherever I desire. Some surface-level examination has revealed that this should be possible, but not simple.<BR>I will need to study levitation further, and ways to channel Vis appropriately to produce a stable levitating force. This might require me to study some fairly obscure sources of flight firsthand, so I should take steps to ensure my research will not be abruptly ended by an unexpected fall. I believe such a source can be found in The End, where there is presumably a creature that uses a form of levitation as a specialized attack. 
research.m_LEVITATE.text=Be levitated by a creature from The End.
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_harness.1=The secrets of true levitation-based flight have been revealed to me, and I have now finalised my design for what I am calling the Thaumostatic Harness.<BR>The device operates by using stored Vis to anchor itself to the Aural Field, essentially hooking onto the ambient field the Aura creates. This will allow me to defy gravity for as long as the device has Vis. I must also continue wearing it, of course.<BR>To use the harness, I simply need to charge it with Vis, equip it as a chest bauble and jump twice while in the air. To deactivate it, I can either land on solid ground or double jump again. With the amount of Vis the device can store, I should be able to fly continuously for a few minutes. However, while the Thaumostatic Harness is active, I will be unable to refill the Vis buffer. This means I will need to either land or unequip the harness for Vis-restoring items to work properly.

thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_gyroscope.title=사우모스태틱 자이로스코프
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_gyroscope.0=Thaumostatic flight is somewhat prone to drifting. I do not come to an immediate halt when I stop moving, which while not a major issue can be annoying at times when precision is required.<BR>It should not be too difficult for me to design an upgrade that will make flight a little more stable, probably with some additional regulators in charge of controlling movement.
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_gyroscope.1=This new augmentation for the Thaumostatic Harness stabilizes flight greatly, preventing drift when I stop moving. These gyroscopic stabilizers carefully regulate the velocity output of the harness, ensuring that I can always come to a quick halt. Like all other augments, this upgrade can be combined with a Thaumostatic Harness by placing the harness and gyroscopes in a crafting grid, while placing an augmented harness alone in a crafting grid will remove the augment.<BR>Unfortunately, stabilized flight comes with a few downsides. The increased regulation required to allow stopping quickly also limits the maximum speed achievable with the harness, but this may not be so debilitating for precise tasks like building. I have also been forced to slightly reduce the size of the integrated Vis buffer by about 25%. However, the fact that the harness now moves more slowly should also lead to decreased Vis usage, so this may not be a problem in practice.

thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_girdle.title=사우모스태틱 허리띠
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_girdle.0=While Thaumostatic flight is already an excellent mode of transportation, the speed of flight it provides is quite limited. I may be able to make some further adjustments to maximise the velocity output of the harness. Finding the right balance between speed and Vis cost may be a bit of a challenge, however.
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_girdle.1=As expected, I have been successful in creating an upgrade for the Thaumostatic Harness that raises the maximum speed I can fly at, without compromising too much in other areas. This Thaumostatic Girdle is an additional belt that allows the harness to draw more Vis from its internal buffer at once to facilitate faster speeds. It can be attached to the harness by combining them together in a crafting grid, while placing the augmented harness alone in the grid will remove the girdle.<BR>In addition to the aforementioned increased Vis cost, the Thaumostatic Girdle makes flight much less stable, meaning I need to be careful with the large amount of drift that can occur when I stop moving. On a more positive note, I was able to increase the size of the Vis buffer by 25% and allow the harness to support sprinting while flying for even faster speeds. Using this sprint ability comes at no additional Vis cost.

thaumicaugmentation.research.elytra_harness.title=겉날개 하네스
thaumicaugmentation.research.elytra_harness.0=In my multidimensional travels I have happened across a truly fascinating object: a pair of insectoid gliding wings. While a great deal of their origins are shrouded in mystery, I do know that these wings come from hovering ships docked at the abandoned cities in the outer islands of The End. Clearly some long-deceased race of beings once created these cities and used these wings, though whether their origins were mundane or magical is unclear to me. It makes me wonder what their relation was to the abandoned structures littering The End: were they used by scouts to protect trade ships? Wage wars with mighty floating vessels against rival cities? While I do not think I will be unlocking any major secrets about the structures, at least I have these wings to examine.<BR>This Elytra is unique in that instead of offering direct flight, it provides a surprisingly versatile means of gliding, enabling me to attain impressive speeds if I dare to push the limits of both the wings and my bravery.<BR>However, the Elytra do have a few shortcomings. First and foremost, I cannot wear them at the same time as any other chestplate or robe. They also suffer from degradation quite quickly while in use, requiring almost constant maintenance. After I become accustomed to the style of gliding these wings provide, I should be able to apply some thaumaturgical principles to solve both of these issues.
research.m_ELYTRAFLY.text=Gain some experience flying with elytra.
thaumicaugmentation.research.elytra_harness.1=I have managed to create a successful design for an upgrade to the elytra. The flight harness I previously designed acts as the base for these upgrades, and allowed me to make quite a few improvements.<BR>Firstly, the Elytra Harness can be worn as a chest bauble, meaning I no longer have to choose between armour and gliding. Despite relocating the elytra to this area, its mode of operation is still the same: jump while falling to begin gliding.<BR>Second, I have done a great deal to mitigate the poor durability of the original elytra. My first modification was adding a light void metal weave throughout the wings. While they are still burdened by durability, this allows the wings to slowly repair themselves when not in use. Furthermore, I have also applied a protective ward that allows Vis to be consumed instead of damaging the wings. This protective shield only contains 50 points of Vis, and cannot be regenerated while in the air, but it can prevent any durability from being lost on shorter flights.<BR>Even with all of my improvements, it is still possible for the elytra to break mid-flight in extreme situations. I should carefully monitor their condition to ensure I do not suddenly drop out of the sky. Thankfully, in the event this does occur, the elytra will still be functional after they are given time to repair themselves.<BR>Lastly, I took the opportunity to allow the Elytra Harness to have a bit of a personal touch. I am able to apply any kind of banner to replace the appearance of the wings with that of the banner. This applies to mundane banners, which will apply their colour and patterns to the elytra, but also for Thaumaturgic banners, which will apply their colour and aspect insignia. For added flair, the color of the banner will also be applied to the sparkling trail that appears as I fly.<BR>Other cosmetic items may work as an upgrade as well - there is no harm in trying to see if it does indeed work.<BR>To apply a banner or other upgrade, I just need to place it and the harness in a crafting grid. Removing the upgrade is as simple as placing the harness by itself in a crafting grid.

thaumicaugmentation.research.elytra_booster.title=겉날개 추진법
thaumicaugmentation.research.elytra_booster.0=Despite how effective elytra gliding can be, there is one major problem with it: it is not true flight. It requires finding a high enough point to fall from to gain a decent amount of momentum; if I am in a flat area, I am out of luck. I suppose I could use a mundane contraption with pistons and slime blocks, but that requires setup ahead of time and is not a mobile solution.<BR>I do have some inspiration to work off of, in the form of fireworks. If I am gliding and set off an ordinary firework, it will boost me a fair distance. This method is not particularly good, however. It requires large amounts of gunpowder to be sustainable, and I can only carry so many of them. Besides, any self-respecting Thaumaturge such as myself would not want to be caught resorting to such mundane measures.<BR>I considered using Vis to emulate the boosting effect of a firework, but the protective durability shield of the Elytra Harness already uses Vis, and I am uncertain that Vis would be able to produce a strong, pushing force anyway. My recent discovery of the more volatile Impetus, however, opens up some new possibilities.<BR>I will need to study mundane fireworks first, and from there I can begin the process of recreating their pushing effect with a device that uses Impetus energy. I will need to be even more cautious than usual, as I will be experimenting with both explosive gunpowder and chaotic void energy. It seems that my research always leads me to danger, no matter how mundane or magical it might be...
thaumicaugmentation.research.elytra_booster.1=By emulating the explosive force of fireworks with Impetus, I can finally elevate the Elytra Harness to the level of true flight. The Impetus Thruster upgrade, as I have named it, expels stored Impetus to quickly increase my velocity in the direction I am looking.<BR>This augment can be attached and removed in the usual way: placing it with the Elytra Harness in a crafting grid to attach it, and placing the harness alone in the grid to remove it. I will also need to charge it with Impetus using one of my previously discovered methods.<BR>To activate the thruster, I only need to hold jump. To conserve Impetus, I may wish to boost in short bursts by holding down jump for short intervals, as the thruster does have a limit to how fast it can make me move.

thaumicaugmentation.research.more_golemancy.title=Further Golemancy Studies
thaumicaugmentation.research.more_golemancy.0=While I have made great strides in Golemancy thus far, sometimes working with golems can be a bit... inconvenient. I should research some ways to reduce my frustration with them.

thaumicaugmentation.research.autocaster.title=오토캐스터
thaumicaugmentation.research.autocaster.0=I have already had success in the creation of automated weaponry, with Automated Crossbows being rather effective for use in ranged defense. However, despite the complex magical mechanisms used in their creation, they still only fire mundane arrows (although potion-tipped arrows can create some interesting effects). I personally have the option to use a different means of ranged attack in the form of foci, so I now wonder if it is possible to automate this as well.<BR>This will not be a simple matter however, since casting even simple foci requires an understanding of the ebb and flow of the magical energies involved and knowledge of how to correctly focus Vis, both of which require an intimate connection with the aura. Making a mere machine do all of this will not be an easy task.<BR>Fortunately, it seems I am not alone in this train of thought, as my recent discovery of ruins in the Emptiness has revealed ancient automatic spell-casters held within, which I may be able to reverse-enginneer in order to design my own.
thaumicaugmentation.research.autocaster.1=This was not an easy device to finalise, but with the understanding of the ancient spell-casters and with some effort spent into better connecting machines to the Aura, I have completed my plans for what I am calling the Autocaster. Reverse-engineering the ancient device was cruicial here; it was quite ingeniously designed, and I now better understand how one can recreate the spiritual connection a sentient being might have to the Aura in something mechanical.<BR>As with the original Eldritch casters, it consists of a central sphere (an unusual choice in this distinctly cuboid world perhaps, but it seems to be the most optimized design) which contains most of the mechanisms. The sphere is gently levitated on a metal base, which allows it to rotate freely. I can place it on any solid floor, wall, or ceiling, and the Autocaster will immediately begin looking for targets. Because I integrated biothaumics into the design of this device, I can configure what it targets through its interface, accessible by right-clicking it.<BR>However, the device can do nothing without a focus. I can attach one through the Autocaster's menu, simply by placing it in the dedicated slot. With a focus attached and an appropriate target found, the device will begin using Vis from the local aura to cast spells at the target. If there is not enough Vis nearby it will fail to cast the spell, as would be expected. It is no Thaumaturge, however, so the foci cast are only as effective as those used in a basic Caster's Gauntlet. This also means that it will be unable to receive any augmentation to improve its casting. Much like my other automated devices, I can deactivate it by providing a redstone signal (as long as this feature is enabled in its menu), and interacting with the Autocaster while sneaking will allow me to pick it back up.<BR>Despite it not being as effective as a seasoned Thaumaturge like myself, it still can use nearly all of the focus effects that I can. Therefore, I could get very creative with how I use this device. Lastly, I should note that while I can configure what the Autocaster targets, this only determines what it will attempt to fire spells at. It will not change how the focus effect naturally behaves. For example, if I have a focus effect tuned to home in on a hostile target and the caster configured to target myself, then the spell will be fired in my direction but then may still home in on any hostile mobs that are in the area. I could create some very complex systems with this behavior, but I should be careful to ensure that it only does what I intend it to.
thaumicaugmentation.research.autocaster.2=With my discovery of focus effects that use Impetus in their casting process, I should note that the Autocaster will not be able to cast them without external assistance. This assistance can be in the form of any device capable of transferring normal, uncharged Impetus at a distance. The Autocaster can store a very small amount of Impetus in some of its Eldritch-derived components, but nowhere near the level of an Impetus Cell. I should ensure it has reliable access to Impetus to maintain continued operation.

thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_shield.title=포커스 효과: 공허 방벽
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_shield.0=With my recent expeditions into the Emptiness and the ruins that lie within it, I have discovered that certain particulary powerful creatures have the ability to summon magical shields that follow them around and block my attacks. They are quite effective at defending said creatures, and as such I would very much like to recreate them for myself.<BR>While I could settle for carrying around a physical shield, I would like to replicate the magical nature of the shields I saw. I will need to find a way to summon them on-demand, and I believe that I can do so via a special focus effect.<BR>In order to design this focus effect, I will need to study both the protective magic of warded arcana, but also the more esoteric area of Impetus. The former makes enough sense for this application, but I require the latter as summoning large semi-physical objects with Vis alone is very difficult. Impetus should provide enough force to be able to create tangible shields that follow me around.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_shield.1=By studying both Impetus and defensive foci, I have designed a new focus pattern that can create shields very similar to those used by the powerful entities in the Emptiness. This Void Shield focus effect uses the structured magical power of the praecantatio aspect, and not praemunio as I first anticipated - the latter resulted in effects that were far too static.<BR>To even use this focus effect, I will need to have Impetus available for my Caster's Gauntlet to consume, such as from a charged Impetus Conductor. Failing to have enough Impetus available will result in the shield failing to materialize.<BR>Assuming I do successfully create a shield, it will follow and protect the entity it was cast on. I can target any entity with this effect, not just myself, but missing an entity completely will result in no shield being created. If I wish to remove a summoned shield, I only need to sneak while casting the focus effect on the target. I can only remove shields that I created, however.<BR>This shield will follow its target and remain in front of their view. It will also block other creatures and projectiles from walking through it. It will never block me, and it will even allow most of my attacks to pass through unaffected. As with everything magical, however, there are always exceptions, so I should experiment ahead of time to ensure I do not accidentally damage my own shield in the heat of battle.<BR>I can control two variables relating to Void Shields in the Focal Manipulator. The first is the shield's durability, which dictates how much damage it can take before dissapating, as well as how long the shield can exist in the world for before decomposing. I also have the option of reflecting projectiles hit by the shield, causing them to bounce back in the direction they came from. Unfortunately, the shield will still take damage when reflecting projectiles.

thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_water.title=포커스 효과: 물
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_water.0=I have already managed to create multiple focus effects that harnessed the power of the primal elements. However, there is one that I have neglected thus far: Aqua. Although Gelum is similar, and water is generally seen as fairly benign, it may still be useful.<BR>I will need to examine water even more than I already have to better understand its potential. I have already managed to use Vis to conjure water with the Everfull Urn, so I have a good starting point for conjuring water by hand. I might need to personally study large amounts of water first hand, but as I can already create water this should be a trivial matter.
research.m_LONGTIMEINWATER.text=Spend some time in the deep depths.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_water.1=After a somewhat unpleasant and very soggy underwater experience, the power of water is now at my fingertips.<BR>This new focus effect will allow me to summon a torrent of water that can cool lava into solid blocks, fill water receptacles such as cauldrons and crucibles, hydrate farmland, and extinguish fires on surfaces and creatures. Fires will even be put out in a fairly large area around the area where it is cast, so I do not need to aim it directly at them. The water will also quickly dissipate afterwards if not aimed at a liquid container, so I do not need to worry about creating floods.<BR>While this effect's usefulness in combat is limited the majority of the time, this is not true for all creatures. The fiery blaze, as an example, will find this effect to be particulary potent. On the other hand, it will completely fail to harm mobs that are native to the water, giving them a chance to breathe on land instead. I suppose this is what is to be expected from trying to drown a fish, after all.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_water.2=Because water evaporates almost instantly in hellish environments like the Nether, I expect the water focus to be much less effective in these areas. It should still have enough power to put out fires, but I doubt it will be able to affect anything else in the world, such as lava.

thaumicaugmentation.research.fortified_glass.title=요새화 유리
thaumicaugmentation.research.fortified_glass.0=There are quite a few entries in the old manuscripts covering Warded Arcana, but one of the most unique is that of Warded Glass. While ancient Thaumaturges seem to have had little trouble in creating it, the notes covering this section are obnoxiously incomplete, and such I have been unable to properly recreate the glass so far. Despite all of my efforts, I simply cannot find a way to integrate a Warding Sigil to something that is less active than a door or chest.<BR>I could perhaps study Warded Jars a little more, but they are only warded in the sense that they are resistant to certain substances or sources of damage, so I am unsure if they will provide any inspiration. I am sure I can come up with something to show for my efforts, but it may not be quite like what is described in these manuscripts.
thaumicaugmentation.research.fortified_glass.1=While fully warded glass has to remain a dream for now, I have come reasonably close, given the limited amount of information I had to work off of. This material I am calling Fortified Glass essentially uses the same process that I use for creating Warded Jars, but scaled up to a full block.<BR>This glass is not completely indestructible, but it is very resistant to mundane damage. Explosions, for example, should be no problem for it. I also find it is rather aesthetically pleasing, so I might be able to find a use for it in decoration.<BR>Given that I managed to create a full cubic meter of this glass, creating panes out of it is rather simple. Other than the reduced size, Fortified Glass Panes retain all of the physical properties of the original.

thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_rift.title=별무리 유리: 균열
thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_rift.0=The Void between dimensions is an inhospitable place that can hardly be called a place at all. It is hostile to life, to matter, it can house horrors I can scarecely imagine... but it is also so captivating.<BR>I cannot quite put it into words, but something about the starry void that I sometimes see as the result of dimensional manipulation is so very intriguing. Given the chance, I am sure I could spend hours simply staring into it. Something tells me I should not do this, for many say one should not gaze into such an abyss, but I really cannot help myself.<BR>Despite the allure of the Void, I would rather not have to interact too closely with such dangerous dimensional magic too often. However, it should not be too difficult to create a contained breach in dimensions that can create the same effect with none of the risks involved. Or, at least, with the risks safely contained inside a piece of Fortified Glass.
thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_rift.1=Ah, this will be perfect. Fortified Glass was a great choice given my requirements, and now with only a very simple application of dimensional magic I can create Starfield Glass. I can now stare into the Void for as long as I desire, and there will be no need to work around unsafe dimensional anomalies in order to get a proper view.<BR>While it may look dangerous it is, in fact, perfectly safe, as the breach in dimensions is very weak and safely contained within the sturdy glass. It may also appear as if stepping into it would either lead one to The End or into a hostile abyss that would tear one to shreds in an instant, but I can rest assured that there is no risk of any unexpected teleportation, nor of any tears appearing in the fabric of reality from which untold chaos is invited into the world.<BR>Perfectly safe.<BR>Starfield Glass should be ideal for decorating anything I build. In fact, I believe that I may be able to make modifications to its appearance in the future. It would only involve some simple tweaks to the nature of the dimensional breach, or where precisely it leads to.

thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_mirror.title=별무리 유리: 거울
thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_mirror.0=Magic mirrors of all kinds send matter through the Void between worlds in order to transport it from one mirror to another. I can see into this space by looking into a linked magic mirror of any type, but my view is limited by the edges of the frame. I would very much like to get a proper look into this space, since it seems strangely different to the Void I have seen through rifts, and with a better view I might be able to learn more about it.<BR>I have already managed to create Starfield Glass that contains a view similar to that of a rift, so with some simple modifications to the dimensional breach it should be possible to make the window look into the exact space magic mirrors lead to.
thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_mirror.1=With only some minor adjustments to my previous Starfield Glass, I now have a new type which views the same starfield that can be seen inside magic mirrors. This variant of the glass is still perfectly safe, as the glass does not push items into a higher dimensional space like a mirror does.<BR>With this new insight gained into the space behind magic mirrors, I have learned more about its nature. From what I can tell, this space is still a Void, but it is a more compressed section of it. This unique compression of the dimensional plane allows matter to be sent through with the help of sympathetic mirror magic. While the appearance differs from that of a rift, it shares its hostility to life or anything akin to it. 

thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_fracture.title=별무리 유리: 차원의 틈
thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_fracture.0=With my discovery of dimensional fractures, and my recent expeditions into the Emptiness via said fractures, I have noticed that the starry sky visible in both is oddly similar and yet remarkably different to the Void visible through flux rifts. I'd quite like to get a proper look at this fascinating view... purely for research purposes, of course.<BR>This should be easy to do, as I just need to modify my previously created Starfield Glass so that it is attuned to the specific part of the Void the Emptiness exists within. It will not be stable enough to allow objects to pass through without consequences, but for visual purposes it should suffice.
thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_fracture.1=A trivial task really, and now I can build a new type of Starfield Glass which views the same sky that can be seen in the Emptiness and inside of dimensional fractures. As before, there is zero risk of cross-dimensional travel when stepping into it, and as such it is perfectly safe to use for decorating my lab or home.<BR>With all of these studies, I am starting to better grasp the truth of the Void. It is a very strange truth, with the Void seeming to be a paradoxical mix of nothing and yet also 'something', as empty space is still a tangible concept in itself (which can be seen by the presence of the Vacuos aspect). The exact 'something' is very chaotic, however, as it is so vague it constantly fluctuates in numerous states that act like baseline reality, like nothing and also like something completely different to reality and nothing. These fluctuations disrupt and likely destroy anything more tangible that comes into contact with them. Furthermore, the Void is so vast that, in certain sections of it, these fluctuations may balance out to a limited degree, giving these parts particular characteristics and appearances. The factors that determine these properties I do not, and perhaps cannot, fully know.<BR>It is difficult to put into words something that actively defies them, and much still perlexes me, even with my capacity for knowledge. Perhaps I should spend some time with a proper view into the Void, so I can better enlighten myself to the vastness of the Universe and that which goes beyond it. Some may accuse me of staring into space, but 'space' would imply that there is nothing to see, which in this case is evidently not true.

thaumicaugmentation.research.more_mechanisms.title=More Mechanisms
thaumicaugmentation.research.more_mechanisms.0=With my new access to magical types of wood and stone, I may wish to make simple mechanisms out of these materials instead of their mundane counterparts. It will not be a challenge to replicate simple contraptions, such as pressure plates and buttons, with different materials.
thaumicaugmentation.research.more_mechanisms.1=I have designed variants of pressure plates and buttons that use my new materials instead of normal wood and stone. The new wood buttons and pressure plates can be made from either silverwood or greatwood, and they act like their oak counterparts. Arcane stone acts in a similar way to average stone.<BR>One interesting note is that I only seem to be able to create these alternate mechanism designs using an arcane workbench. Whenever I attempt to build the wooden mechanisms without it, the end results look suspiciously close to oak wood. I am not quite sure why I cannot seem to keep the distinct appearance of these materials when crafting them on my own, but I suppose I should appreciate the assistance of the arcane workbench.

thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_openers.title=Arcane Mechanisms
thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_openers.0=Redstone mechanisms are extremely versatile and useful, even to a Thaumaturge like myself. One issue with them, however, is that I cannot control who can activate them in some cases. It is all well and good to have pressure plates handle opening my doors, until I have a monster infestation in my house. With my recent rediscovery of Warded Arcana, however, I think I can solve this problem.<BR>First of all, I think my greatwood, silverwood, and arcane stone mechanisms are good candidates for this task. Not only are they visually appealing, but their aptitude for magic should make it easier for me to ward them. The only challenge left will be making the ward allow activating the mechanisms but not otherwise affecting them, but if I was able to do this to a chest, I am sure I can do the same to these devices.
thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_openers.1=I have successfully created warded versions of each of the silverwood, greatwood, and arcane stone mechanisms. They will only activate by my actions alone, ignoring those created by any other entity. If they are activated, they will produce a redstone signal in the same way as their mundane counterparts.<BR>As usual, to remove a permanently warded object, I need to sneak and interact with the object while holding a caster's gauntlet to remove it.
thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_openers.2=I have discovered an interesting interaction between my arcane mechanisms and arcane doors. Despite the fact that arcane doors ignore normal redstone signals, it seems that adjacent arcane mechanisms can cause them to open if activated. This will only occur if the door recognizes the creature activating the mechanism as permitted, however, so I do not need to worry about someone using this property to bypass my Arcane Doors. I should also note that this only applies to the immediate area around the mechanisms - they are not able to be transferred over distances like redstone signals.

thaumicaugmentation.research.eldritch_spire.title=공허 탐사
thaumicaugmentation.research.eldritch_spire.0=There is more to the Emptiness than I have once expected. One might assume a world so close to the Void could not be anything but a barren wasteland, but alongside the areas infested with taint there is something that sets my teeth on edge. Something that has pierced its way in this place like a splinter in the skin of the dimensional boundaries. I cannot be too surprised, as reality here is far more malleable due to the many fractures that have been made in it, and how one wrong step can send me tumbling into an inhospitable abyss. With reality that unstable, it was almost guaranteed that some malicious influence would appear or otherwise make its way here - if they were not here from the beginning.<BR>For a while now, I have slowly been coming to the realization that the Eldritch may refer to far more than a branch of Thaumaturgy, or to knowledge that can twist one's mind with Warp. The Crimson Rites, in particular, was filled with uses of the phrase 'The Eldritch' in ways that would put it far above that, in a way that would suggest that merely knowing that such things exist is something reserved to those who are destined to go beyond the mundane world I have come to know. To them, uttering the phrase must be almost blasphemous, something that no ordinary being should ever be allowed to do, let alone a Thaumaturge such as myself.<BR>No, the Eldritch cannot simply refer to this branch of magic centered around the Void. Instead, I believe it refers to a race of beings that have existed for a very, very long time, and who have had an effect on the world that has shaped much of what I treat as fact, or as being perfectly normal. If they exist, it could explain many of the oddities I have discovered, particular quirks in magical principles, why certain creatures are present in the world, and how some can lose their minds so utterly that they form sects made entirely of madmen dedicated to a ritual that can do nothing good.<BR>If I am to fully understand any of this, I will have to explore the Emptiness further, to discover what exactly is causing this disturbance in the aura. This Eldritch influence will almost certainly be hostile to something as comparatively small as myself, but knowledge often requires risk, and I cannot turn back now. Not with the power that such knowledge may offer me.
research.m_ENTERSPIRE.text=Discover something peculiar in the Emptiness.
thaumicaugmentation.research.eldritch_spire.1=I have found something in the Emptiness. Ruins, ancient, created and placed here for a reason I do not know, although I am certain it is the work of the Eldritch. I can feel the disturbance in the surrounding magic field very strongly here, so this is precisely what I was looking for. Or, perhaps, these ruins contain what I am looking for.<BR>The ruins themselves are made up of many different parts, a series of chambers built around a central spire. At the bottom of this spire are a set of unusual doors, constructed using a form of magic that I am not entirely familiar with, although I do recognize the the presence of dimensional magic within their mechanisms. The lock at their centre seems to be a receptor for something, and I believe impetus might be the key. A charged impetus conductor attached to a caster's gauntlet should suffice - I only need to use it on the lock to open the door and unleash whatever lurks inside.<BR>While I cannot find out more until I enter the ruins, one important thing I have noticed is that a powerful protective ward is being held upon these ruins, likely by a powerful force within them. Until I enter these ruins and destroy the source of this power, I will be unable to break my way through the dungeon. Some chunks of stone seem to have been damaged over time, however, and the ward seems to have faded from these locations. In the event I find any of these weakened segments blocking my path, I should be able to break them freely.<BR>Given the size, complexity, and unnerving feel of these ruins, whatever lurks within them will almost certainly pose a threat to me. If I am not properly prepared for a fight, I should probably head back home and make preparations before I continue. Having come so far, it would truly be a shame to die now at the hands of that which I am trying so hard to fully understand.
research.m_BOSSROOM.text=Uncover the secrets of the Eldritch Spire.
thaumicaugmentation.research.eldritch_spire.2=This room... this altar... I have seen this before! Pages within the Crimson Rites held drawings, within which were depicted such strange things, all around an altar just like this one! I can see that this is the very heart of the spire, it holds the protective ward in place and corrupts the aura around it. However, the altar is unbreakable, so I must find another way to stop its influence.<BR>...I know what I must do. Apertis Oculis. I must Open the Eye of the altar. I know very little about the ritual, so little that I do not know what will happen once I perform it, but I can see that the altar is fully prepared, so all I need to do is use my Casting Gauntlet on the central pedestal to cast the final invocation.<BR>I should prepare for what happens next, whatever it is cannot be good. Something powerful is watching me here. I can feel it.
research.m_ELDRITCHBOSS.text=Open the Eye and discover what it sees.
thaumicaugmentation.research.eldritch_spire.3=When I performed the ritual, Apertis Oculis, at the altar, I was not sure what I was expecting to happen. Perhaps I thought it would have simply stopped the spire's influence on the area around it. Really, I should have known better. It was never going to be that easy.<BR>The powerful being that appeared from the portal was the true source of the ruins' corruption, the altar was merely an anchor for it to hold onto across the dimensional planes. However, after forcing it into the Emptiness via the ritual I was able to kill it, and I can feel that the dimensional boundaries have stabilized somewhat, meaning that the protective ward that previously stopped me from damaging the structure has also dissipated. If I wish to do so, I can more freely explore the ruins and mine the various blocks that make them up; I may be able to find some additional trinkets and collect a nice variety of new building materials for me to use.<BR>Aside from that, I discovered something interesting that the spire's apparent curator left behind: a set of tattered scrolls. I do not know why the being dropped them nor how such ancient scrolls have managed to survive intact, but after scanning them I can see that they contain knowledge incredibly useful to me, most likely about Auromancy and Impetus. These will be the key to my continued research; I shall write about them more in a further entry.<BR>Despite my success in stopping the malicious force that these ruins held, I can sense that the aura in the Emptiness is still twisted. I am certain that other Eldritch Spires may be found there, each containing another ritual altar anchoring another malevolent being to it. If I so wish, I can repeat what I have already done and fight my way through them. While this will be tiring, I will almost certainly gain more useful trinkets and resources. For future reference, the first door of the spire is opened with impetus cast from a gauntlet, the various other doors are opened with keys found throughout other parts of the spire, and the ritual altar in the final room can be forced to summon the spire's master by using my casting gauntlet on it.<BR>After all of this, I am left with some questions though. What is the true purpose of these spires? Why do they hold such useful trinkets and resources? Will I find further copies of these ancient scrolls as well? What are these beings, and how have they become so powerful? I believe it is no accident that I found these notes, but I cannot stop now.

thaumicaugmentation.research.eldritch_epiphany.title=Eldritch Epiphany
thaumicaugmentation.research.eldritch_epiphany.0=I have made excellent progress with translating the ancient scrolls, and while what I have learned is perhaps not what I expected, it is precisely what I needed. As I suspected, the parts I translated cover two main areas of magic: Auromancy and Impetus. I shall cover each area separately.<BR>Firstly, Auromancy. This was one of the areas of translation that confused me the most, and for a very good reason: it seems that the aura of the distant past was quite different than the one I am familiar with. The aura in its current state is a field of magical energy, vis, that exists in higher dimensions and which permeates through many dimensional planes in fluctuating amounts. Certain areas and dimensions have weaker dimensional boundaries thus more vis is able to seep in, and the inverse is equally true. However, these scrolls reveal that the aura was not always like this, and that the connection to the other side was once far more tangible and focused, semi-physically present in the form of 'Aura Nodes'. Vis would have to be directly drawn from these nodes in order to cast spells or operate devices, instead of simply drawing it from the surrounding area. Furthermore, the vis would come naturally attuned to different aspects, as opposed to having to manually attune the vis via essentia crystals or foci. This explains some of the oddities in design I noticed about the older wands I abandoned in favour of my gauntlets: they were designed for a very different version of the aura.<BR>Something very clearly happened to the aura nodes, and based on some rough theory working I have performed I can ascertain that they dispersed over a very long period of time. Initially, they spread out to a limited degree, with nodes feeding the surrounding area with different types of vis (meaning that at this period of time drawing vis directly from nodes for use in magic was not viable, and instead it was drawn from the area like I do now). Eventually, this dispersion became so severe that the nodes vanished entirely, leaving only numerous tiny invisible dimensional cracks from which pure non-attuned vis could flow through. However, I am fearful as to what may have induced this process. At first I thought it might have been a natural process, the aura gradually evolving over the aeons, but this does not seem right. There are, however, some strong hints at a true answer revealed by the next section.<BR>Secondly, the scrolls provided some tantalizing hints about impetus and how I might be able to better manipulate it. Notably, the text in this section of the notes is hastily scrawled, and the tone within seems to be far more urgent. While the writer seemed perplexed as to the nature of impetus (a feeling I can attest to), they did manage to provide me with a formula for a specialized jewel that can effectively resonate impetus energy, which should allow me to properly focus, transport and use it. In essence, I should be able to transmit impetus in the form of energy beams, given some extra research.<BR>I am a little puzzled as to the somewhat contradictory nature of the ancient mage's understanding of impetus though. Apparently, they had struggled to find a way to create impetus reliably, despite their knowledge of how to properly focus and transmit it. With regards to the latter point, I believe it may be because they already had familiarity with using the ancient form of vis in a more focused fashion, transporting vis energy beams via crystal relays instead of drawing the energy from the surrounding area, and thus they had a starting point for which to use with impetus transfer. As for the former point, this implies something far more sinister.<BR>The only reason I can see for an accomplished ancient Thaumaturge being unable to reliably create impetus is that they did not have access to all of the magical phenomena that I do. If the nature of vis and the aura has changed over the aeons, then might that mean the nature of flux has never been fully consistent either? The presence of aura nodes would almost certainly have a big impact on how it would behave, and while I am not sure, I think the creation of flux rifts might not have been possible in their presence. If this is true, then there would be no reliable way to summon impetus energy, and thus an ancient Thaumaturge would have to rely on some other, likely far more dangerous, means of obtaining it.<BR>This troubles me. If flux rifts are a recent phenomenon, at least in terms of the vast timescales that entire universes operate by, then might this mean that something is forcefully attempting to shape reality in order to enable their creation? While this could be an entirely natural process, something about this all strikes me as so utterly twisted. What is happening to the aura to make it so… corrupt? If some malicious force wanted the creation of flux rifts to be possible, then perhaps it would explain the ancient aura nodes' gradual disappearance, since without them there is nothing to prevent flux rifts from opening in high flux areas. But if this is all true, then why would this force want flux rifts to be opened at all, and how would it be able to manipulate the aura so entirely so to make aura nodes vanish? Do dimensional fractures and the Emptiness play a part here perhaps?<BR>I am loath to fully admit it, but if this is all true then I can only think of one force powerful enough to induce such a change in our world. The Eldritch. They want something with our world, with those who occupy it, with the Crimson Cult, with me, but I do not know what that is. I don't even know if I would be able to fully comprehend the answer if it was right in front of me. But I must continue my research nonetheless, because with this discovery I have been granted a great potential for power, and I know I can use this power to bend reality as I see fit. They will not stop me. Some might say they would travel to Hell and back to see their goals through, but the Nether is nothing next to the places I have been to, all to further my understanding of the forces that underlie magic.

thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus.1=이제, 이제 나는 진정으로 임페투스를 사용할 수 있습니다.<BR>이전에 공허 흡수기를 위해 만들었던 도식을 이용하여, 자동으로 임페투스를 수집, 운반, 공명, 분배할 수 있는 근본적인 장치를 만들 수 있도록 디자인을 수정할 수 있었습니다. 이제 어떻게 하면 임페투스 동력 시스템을 적절히 설명할 수 있을지를 다루어야 하며, 이를 위해 모든 것을 관련된 다양한 개념, 도구 및 장치를 다루는 별도의 부분으로 나누어야 합니다.<BR>하지만 시작하기 전에, 나는 새로운 것을 배울 때, 종종 어떤 것을 이해하는 가장 좋은 방법은 그것을 물리적으로 직접 실험하는 것이라는 것에 주목해야 한다고 느낍니다. 또한 임페투스가 이해하기에 복잡한 주제라는 것을 알아야 하며, 우연히 특정 부분을 잊어버리거나 임페투스 매커니즘에 대해 혼란스러워 해도 놀라지 않을 것입니다. 따라서 자세히 설명한 항목에 대해 완전히 혼란스럽다면, 관련된 원리를 더 잘 이해할 수 있도록 직접 몇 가지 간단한 임페투스 에너지 설정을 만들고 실험하는 것이 도움일 될 것입니다. 이 복잡하고 위험한 주제를 완전히 이해하기 위해서 신중한 공부를 선호하는지 아니면 실제적인 실험을 선호하는지 봐야 할 것 같습니다.<PAGE>차지 임페투스<DIV>전에는 그것이 만들어 낸 공허 씨앗과 건틀렛에 부착된 전도체에 저장된 임페투스를 통해 상당히 간접적으로만 임페투스에 접근할 수 있었습니다. 하지만 이 새로운 발견으로 이제 활력 있는 다른 형태로 임페투스를 모을 수 있게 되었습니다. 이 새로운 형태의 임페투스를 '차지 임페투스'로 부르기로 했습니다 이 둘은 구별될 것입니다.<BR>정상적인 임페투스는 공기 중으로 나부끼는 별빛 공허의 선으로 볼 수 있으며, 보통 플럭스 균열에서 직접 뽑힙니다. 이것은 지금까지 내가 써옷 것이며 공허 흡수기와 전도체가 사용하는 것입니다. 정상적인 임페투스에 접근하는 기기는 자극원으로부터 그것을 게으르게 끌어내는 경향이 있으며, 다시 말해 이것들은 보통 플럭스 균열의 형태를 띱니다. 특히, 정상적인 임페투스의 흔적을 만지는 것은 해가 되지는 않지만... 적어도, 아마도, 아무런 손상 없이 나를 통과하는 것처럼 보입니다.<BR>그러나 차지 임페투스는 훨씬 더 변덕스럽기 때문에 훨씬 더 잠재적인 사용처가 많습니다. 이렇게 충전된 형태로 만들면 더 많은 양의 임페투스를 더 먼 거리로 옮길 수 있습니다. 그것은 내가 계획한 전문화된 기계에 동력을 공급할 것이며, 그것들을 통해 얼마만큼의 차지 임페투스가 전송되고 있는지에 따라 희미하거나 밝은 에너지 빔의 형태로 관측 가능합니다. 일반적인 임페투스와는 또 다른 차이점은 차지 임페투스는 근처의 균열에서 대충 끌어내지는 것이 아니라 그것을 사용하는 특정한 장치로 향한다는 것입니다. 후에 이 항목에서 차지 임페투스를 만드는 법을 자세히 설명할 것입니다.<BR>차지 임페투스는 안전을 위해서 오히려 치명적일 정도로 압축된 에너지를 가지고 있다는 것에 주목해야 하며, 그 사이에 끼이면 피해를 입을 것입니다. 다만 비활성 빔은 안전합니다. 비활성 빔은 희미한 에너지로 보이는 반면, 활성 빔은 밝게 빛나며 선명하게 보입니다.<PAGE>임페투스 노드<DIV>월드에 배치된, 차지 임페투스와 연결되는 블록을 집합적으로 '임페투스 노드'라고 부릅니다. 분명히 하자면: 이건 오라 노드와는 관련이 없습니다. 기기가 차지 임페투스를 생성하는지, 사용하는지, 아니면 단순히 전달하는지의 여부는 중요하지 않습니다. 기기가 차지 임페투스에 어떤 형태로든 연결된다면 그것은 임페투스 노드로 분류됩니다.<BR>임페투스 노드는 입출력 슬롯의 정해진 수가 있으며, 이는 차지 임페투스 빔이 얼마나 많은 슬롯에 공급되고 전송될 수 있는지를 나타냅니다. 그러므로 임페투스 노드는 에너지를 한 노드에서 다른 노드로 전달하도록 하거나, 차지 임페투스의 원천에서 다른 한 노드로 에너지를 출력하거나, 이 노드를 다른 노드로 에너지를 충전하거나, 기타 등등이 가능한 디자인입니다. 노드마다 입출력 슬롯의 수가 다릅니다. 예를 들어, 차지 임페투스를 생성하는 장치는 출력 슬롯만 가지고 있고, 차지 임페투스를 전달하는 장치는 입출력을 모두 가지고 있으며, 차지 임페투스를 사용하는 장치는 입력 슬롯만 가지고 있습니다.<PAGE>임페투스 공명장치<DIV>임페투스 노드를 상세하게 설명했지만, 아직 임페투스 노드가 서로 연결되는 형태를 정의하는 방법이 필요합니다. 그런 목적으로 임페투스 공명장치를 설계했습니다.<BR>임페투스 공명장치는 임페투스 노드가 가진 연결을 수정할 수 있는 도구입니다. 장치를 손에 들고 임페투스 노드를 쉬프트 우클릭하면 노드가 파란색으로 강조 표시되며 수정 대상으로 선택됩니다. 같은 노드를 다시 우클릭하면 선택이 취소됩니다.<BR>임페투스 노드를 선택한 상태에서 다른 노드에 우클릭하면 다른 노드에 연결할 수 있습니다. 이렇게 함으로써 첫 번째 노드는 두 번째 노드에 에너지를 출력하도록 설정되고, 첫 번째 노드의 출력 슬롯과 두 번째 노드의 입력 슬롯을 사용하게 됩니다. 두 번째 노드를 다시 마우스 우클릭하면 연결이 제거됩니다. 한 노드에서 다른 여러 노드로 에너지를 보내려면 다른 모든 노드를 하나씩 우클릭하기만 하면 됩니다. 다만 이때 슬롯 제한을 명심해야 합니다. 또한 주목해야 할 점은 빔이 8m 정도의 거리만 이동할 수 있고 불투명한 벽을 통과할 수 없다는 점입니다. 하지만 유리나 다른 투명한 물질은 빔이 통과할 것입니다. 제대로 연결하기 위해선 임페투스 노드가 상당히 가깝게 유지되며 벽으로 방해받지 않게 해야 할 것입니다.<BR>이미 연결이 정의된 임페투스 노드를 선택하면 이 연결들도 시각화됨을 볼 수 있습니다. 선택된 노드에 임페투스를 주는 모든 노드는 빨간색으로 표시되며, 선택한 노드가 임페투스를 보내는 모든 노드는 녹색으로 표시됩니다. 선택한 노드의 입출력이 특별한 경우는 보라색으로 표시됩니다. 확신이 들지 않는다면 어느 방향으로 빔이 흘러가는지에 따라서도 임페투스의 흐름을 알 수 있습니다.<BR>임페투스 공명장치는 노드가 서로 연결되는 방법을 정의할 수 있지만, 임페투스 흡수기가 차지 임페투스를 시스템 안으로 실제로 공급하지 않는다면, 거의 아무 일도 일어나지 않을 것입니다.<PAGE>임페투스 흡수기<DIV>임페투스 흡수기는 플럭스 균열 옆에 있을 때 차지 임페투스를 생성하는 중요한 임페투스 노드입니다. 공허 흡수기에 기초하여 윗부분에 두꺼운 공허합금 조각이 있어 정상적인 임페투스를 끌어냅니다(다행히도, 공허 흡수기의 유일한 용도가 정상적인 임페투스를 공허 씨앗으로 융합시키는 것이었기 때문에 네더의 별은 필요하지 않았습니다). 그리고 회전하는 메커니즘을 활용하여 임페투스를 충전하여 그 중심에 있는 임페투스 보석으로 전달합니다. 따라서 차지 임페투스 시스템의 심장으로 볼 수 있습니다. 흡수기가 균열에서 임페투스를 끌어낼 때 문제의 균열은 공허 흡수기 때와 마찬가지로 점차 줄어들기 시작하고 불안정해질 것입니다. 작은 균열에서 추출하는 것이 큰 균열보다 임페투스를 덜 받는 결과를 가져올 것입니다. 그러므로 추출 중인 균열이 크고 안정되게 유지될 수 있도록 계속 주시해야 합니다.<BR>장치 자체는 하나의 임페투스 빔 출력 슬롯을 가지고 있으며, 차지 임페투스를 생성하기 때문에 입력은 없습니다. 따라서 에너지를 밖으로 빼내 다른 임페투스 노드로 보내려면 임페투스 공명장치로 쉬프트 우클릭한 다음 다른 노드를 우클릭하기만 하면 됩니다.<BR>장치를 끄려면 레드스톤 신호만 주면 됩니다. 이렇게 하면 장치가 근처의 균열을 흡수하지 못하며 임페투스가 생성되지 않으므로, 이것을 사용하여 플럭스 균열을 너무 많이 흡수하지 않도록 할 수 있습니다.<PAGE>임페투스 중계기<DIV>아마도 가장 간단한 유형의 임페투스 노드일 임페투스 중계기는 단순히 한 장소에서 다른 장소로 임페투스 빔을 수송하는 장치입니다. 두 개의 입출력 슬롯을 가지고 있기 때문에 에너지 전송 시스템 작업을 하는데 약간의 여유가 있습니다.<PAGE>임페투스 확산기<DIV>이 장치는 차지 임페투스를 흡수하고 정상 임페투스를 윗부분에서 확산시키기 때문에 임페투스 흡수기의 역행으로 볼 수 있습니다. 임페투스 전도체가 장착된 건틀렛 또는 공허 흡수기와 같은 플럭스 균열을 직접 흡수하는 장치에 동력을 공급하는데 사용할 수 있습니다. 차지 임페투스를 소모하는 장치인 만큼 입력 슬롯이 한 개 있고 출력 슬롯이 없습니다.<BR>확산기가 흡수기에 동력을 공급할 수 없다는 것에 주목해야 합니다. 왜냐하면 그것은 정상적인 임페투스가 차지 임페투스로 변환되고, 확산기를 통해 정상 임페투스로 변환되는 피드백 문제를 야기할 수 있기 때문입니다. 이것이 다시 차지 임페투스로 변환되고, 다시 확산기로 전동되는 피드백 문제를 일으킵니다.<BR>일반적인 임페투스 장치에 동력을 공급하기 위해 이 장치를 사용하는 것이 균열을 직접 흡수하는 것보다 실제로 더 좋은 선택일 것입니다. 충전 과정은 능동적으로 임페투스 생성의 효율성을 향상시키기 때문에, 예전에 설계했던 작품들도 새로운 임페투스 시스템을 사용하는 것이 큰 가치가 있을 것입니다.<BR>흡수기와 마찬가지로, 레드스톤 신호로 장치를 끌 수 있고, 이는 정상적인 임페투스 장치에 동력을 공급하지 못하게 할 것입니다.<BR>이것은 차지 임페투스 동력 시스템의 기본을 다룹니다. 이 진보에도 불구하고, 임페투스를 전달하는 장치들뿐만 아니라 그것을 사용하는 장치들 모두를 가지고 더 많은 것을 배우고 창조할 수 있다는 것을 알고 있습니다.<BR>여기엔 잠재력이 너무나도 많고, 내 마음은 수많은 가능성들과 함께 돌고 있습니다...

thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_gate.title=임페투스 게이트
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_gate.0=차지 임페투스 동력 네트워크는 단순히 노드를 연결하는 것 이상으로 많은 부분으로 구성되어 있어서, 이미 완전히 이해하기엔 충분히 복잡한 문제입니다. 현재로서는 두 노드 간의 연결을 영구적으로 끊지 않고서는 두 노드 간의 동력 전송을 제한할 방법이 없습니다. 이러한 제한은 임페투스 노드 자체 내에서 임페투스 빔을 차단할 수 있는 합리적인 방법을 찾지 못했기 때문에 발생합니다. 빔을 다른 곳으로 보낼 수만 있죠.<BR>보통 이런 상황에선 레드스톤으로 눈을 돌립니다. 레드스톤은 마법을 억제하는 데 탁월하기 때문입니다. 하지만 레드스톤조차도 차지 임페투스 빔을 완전히 억제할 수 없었습니다. 마법 에너지가 너무 응축되어 있어 감당할 수 없을 정도이기 때문입니다. 고맙게도, 결계 마법에 대한 연구가 여기서 유용할 수 있습니다. 이 장치가 다루는 임페투스 중계기와 같은 차지 임페투스 빔 수신으로부터 "보호"하기 위해 간접적으로 사용될 수 있으며, 이러한 보호 행위는 장치 자체 내에서 조절될 수 있습니다. 필요로 하는 정확한 행위를 얻기 위해 더 연구해야 할 것입니다.
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_gate.1=결계 마법과 평범한 레드스톤을 조심스럽게 결합하여 원하는 대로 일시적으로 차지 임페투스 빔을 차단할 수 있는 것을 확인했습니다. 장치에 레드스톤 신호가 전달되지 않으면 정상적인 임페투스 중계기 역할을 합니다. 레드스톤 신호가 전달되면 보호 방어막이 반고체 상태로 진입하여 차지 임페투스가 어느 방향으로든 전달되지 않도록 합니다. 신호가 제거되면 보호막이 빠르게 소멸되고 차지 임페투스가 정상적으로 통과할 수 있습니다.

thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_matrix.title=임페투스 매트릭스
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_matrix.0=내가 발견한 이 차지 임페투스는 미래 잠재력이 매우 크며, 비스보다 훨씬 변덕스럽고 강력하며, 과거에 사용했던 일반적인 임페투스의 형태보다 유연합니다. 그러나 많은 양의 임페투스를 다루는데 있어서 주요한 한 가지 문제는 추출된 후엔 어떻게든 저장이 불가능하다는 사실입니다. 단순히 플럭스 균열을 임페투스 배터리로 취급하는 것은, 균열에서 많은 양의 임페투스를 추출할 수 없는 것은 말할 것도 없고, 균열의 불안정성도 관리해야만 하기에, 나를 이 방향으로 이끌 수밖에 없었습니다. 따라서 더 많은 양의 임페투스를 안전하게, 아니면 최소한 덜 위험하게 저장하는 방법이 이상적일 것입니다.<BR>이미 소량의 정상 임페투스를 저장하는 데는 성공했습니다. 넓게 보자면, 꽤 다양한 방법으로요: 주문 건틀렛에 사용하기 위한 임페투스 전도체, 결합되고 반물리적인 형태인 공허 씨앗, 그리고 가장 중요하게는 일부러 그런 목적으로 만들었던 임페투스 전지가 있습니다. 이 방법들은 모두 일반적인 임페투스에 유효한데 그 이유는 임페투스는 항상 변덕스럽다지만 차지 임페투스 수준에는 전혀 근접하지 않기 때문입니다. 문제의 핵심은 그것이 저장소에 있는 동안 너무 제멋대로 자라지 않도록 하는 동시에, 한순간에 쉽게 사용 가능한 접근성을 찾는 것입니다.<BR>이 딜레마에 대해 곰곰히 생각해보니, 이것을 이뤄낼 수 있을 것이라고 믿습니다. 내가 아는 한에선, 불안정한 차지 임페투스는 잘 유지하지 못한 인퓨정 과정에서 경험할 수 있은 불안정성과 오히려 유사합니다. 인퓨전을 할 때, 인퓨전을 조절하고 안정시키는 데 도움을 주기 위해 루닉 매트릭스를 만들었었는데, 이를 차지 임페투스를 안전하게 억제하기 위해 재사용할 수 있을지도 모른다는 생각이 듭니다. 물론 완벽한 성취와는 거의 확실히 다르겠지만, 이 아이디어가 원칙적으로는 신뢰성 있는 방법입니다.
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_matrix.1=나는 본래 아케인 인퓨전을 관리하는 데 많은 시간과 노력을 들였었습니다. 그것의 초기 목표를 달성하고도 그 노력이 다시 돌파구로 이어진 것으로 보입니다. 구식 오라 노드 관리 장치와 유사한 고정 구조와 결합하여, 임페투스 매트릭스라고 부를 장치를 만들었습니다. 이것이 임페투스를 보조하기 위해 이러한 노드와 관련된 고대 디자인을 재설계한 것이 처음은 아니지만, 그 두 시스템의 유사성에 더 큰 무언가가 숨어 있는 것은 아닌가 하는 의구심이 남는군요. 지금은 임페투스 매트릭스로 내 관심이 쏠려 있기에, 이것에 대해선 나중에 생각하기 위해 정신적인 메모를 해놔야겠습니다.<BR>임페투스 매트릭스를 만드려면 두 개의 엘드리치 주각 사이에 루닉 매트릭스를 배치해야 하는데, 매트릭스 위아래에 하나씩 있어야 합니다. 모든 신비로운 구조물과 마찬가지로 정화의 소금을 하나 사용하여 완전한 구조를 형성해야 하며, 어떤 개별 부속품을 부수면 다시 분리된 구성 요소로 되돌아갈 것입니다.<BR>일단 조립되면, 임페투스 매트릭스는 차지 임페투스 저장을 위한 약간의 추가 준비가 필요합니다. 첫째로, 저장소 역할을 하기 위해서는 주각에 임페투스 전지를 삽입해야 합니다. 전지를 삽입하려면 원하는 주각 옆면에 전지를 사용하기만 하면 됩니다. 주각 하나당 4개의 전지를 측면당 1개씩 수용하여, 총 8개의 전지를 쓸 수 있습니다. 하나만 있어도 작동은 하지만, 더 많은 전지를 추가하면 임페투스 매트릭스가 더 많은 차지 임페투스를 수용할 수 있을 뿐만 아니라, 차지 임페투스를 더 짧은 시간동안 더 많은 양을 매트릭스 내외부로 전송할 수 있을 것입니다. 전지를 제거하려면 전지가 있는 쪽을 빈 손으로 사용하면 됩니다. 불행히도, 남은 전지들이 저장하지 못하는 초과량은 이 때 소멸되므로, 에너지를 낭비하지 않도록 주의해야 합니다.<BR>둘째로, 매트릭스를 안정시켜야 합니다. 차지 임페투스가 매트릭스 내에 저장되면 점차 안정성이 떨어지기 시작할 것이며, 이 안정성 손실은 차지 임페투스가 더 많이 저장될수록 증가합니다. 이 안정성 손실을 막기 위해서, 간단히도 인퓨전 근처에 같은 목적으로 사용했던 동일한 측두체들을 둘 필요가 있습니다. 임페투스 매트릭스의 안정성 구역은 인퓨전 제단보다 작으며, 5x5미터 면적입니다. 물체가 없을 때보다 훨씬 더 불안정해지기를 원하지 않는 한, 여전히 물체들을 매트릭스의 중심점을 기준으로 대칭으로 배치할 필요가 있습니다. 같은 종류의 물체를 도배하는 것과 같은 이유로 인한 이득 감소의 발생은 임페투스 매트릭스에서도 발생하기 때문에, 많은 양의 차지 임페투스를 저장하기 위해선 수많은 종류의 아이템을 얻어야 할 지도 모릅니다.<BR>만약 임페투스 매트릭스가 불안정해진다면, 불안정한 인퓨전과 마찬가지로 주변에 좋지 않은 영향을 미치기 시작할 것입니다. 치명적인 에너지 볼트의 형태로 저장된 임페투스의 일부를 방출 할 수도 있고, 임페투스 전지를 주각 밖으로 밀어내버릴 수도 있습니다. 다행히도 임페투스 매트릭스의 불안정성은 인퓨전보단 덜 강력한데, 사실 그것처럼 지속적인 마법 에너지 폭격을 맞는 활발한 제작 과정을 조절하고 있지는 않으니까요. 이는 매트릭스가 안정된 상태에 도달하기 위해 인퓨전 제단에 필요한 만큼 많은 물체가 필요하진 않다는 것을 의미합니다. 또한 중앙의 루닉 매트릭스를 발견의 고글로 관측하면 임페투스 매트릭스의 총 안정성 손실은 물론 대략적인 안정성 상태도 알 수 있습니다.<BR>마지막으로, 이 모든 단계를 수행하면 임페투스 매트릭스는 차지 임페투스를 안전하게 저장할 준비가 될 것입니다. 임페투스 공명장치를 사용하여 임페투스 빔을 매트릭스 지나는 일반적인 방법이 사용되며, 한 개의 입력과 출력을 수용할 수 있습니다. 매트릭스의 룬 색은 부착된 임페투스 전지가 얼마나 충전되어 있는지에 대한 대략적인 근사치를 보여줄 것입니다. 빨간색은 완전히 비어 있으며, 노란색은 약간, 밝은 초록색은 완전히 충전되어 있음을 나타냅니다. 또한 같은 정보에 해당하는 레드스톤 신호를 얻기 위해 비교기를 임페투스 매트릭스의 아무 부분에 부착할 수 있습니다.

thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_mirror.title=임페투스 거울
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_mirror.0=차지 임페투스의 장거리 이동은 현재 다소 문제가 됩니다. 임페투스 빔은 정해진 거리만 이동할 수 있기 때문에 멀리 떨어진 노드를 연결할 수 있는 많은 중계기와 인내심이 필요합니다. 무식한 접근법보다 더 나은 방법이 있어야 합니다.<BR>장거리 이동은 마법 거울로 이미 성공한 것이지만, 아이템과 기체 에센시아로만 성공했습니다. 동일한 방법을 사용하여 한 거울에서 다른 거울로 임페투스 빔을 원격으로 연결할 수 있어야 하지만, 응축된 차지 형태에서 임페투스가 분해되는 것을 방지하기 위해 몇 가지 특별한 수정이 필요할 것입니다. 마법 거울은 공허의 가장자리를 통해 물질을 전송하기 때문에, 임페투스는 자연스럽게 거울에서 벗어나 더 친숙한 영역으로 돌아가고 싶어할 것입니다.
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_mirror.1=임페투스의 특이한 성질에도 불구하고, 거울 마법의 원리를 성공적으로 적용했고, 이제 거울의 형태로 장거리 차지 임페투스 전달에 접근할 수 있게 되었습니다. 거울의 디자인은 확실히 약간의 수정을 거쳐야 했고, 따라서 그것을 만들기 위해 좀 더 난해한 재료를 필요로 하지만, 그럼에도 불구하고 다른 종류의 마법 거울과 매우 유사하게 기능합니다.<BR>거울을 사용하기 위해서는 먼저 일반적인 거울 한 쌍을 만들고, 하나를 월드에 설치하고, 두 번째 거울을 그 위에 사용하여 서로 연결해야 합니다. 그 다음 거울을 다른 위치에 놓으면 차지 임페투스 빔이 이 거울을 통해 전송될 수 있습니다. 다른 마법 거울과 마찬가지로 이 연결을 어떤 거리와 심지어는 차원을 넘어서도 작동합니다. 하지만, 멀리 떨어져 있는 곳의 시간이 멈춰 있는 것처럼 보이는 일반적인 현상이 여전히 적용되므로, 만약 서로 매우 멀리 떨어져 있는 두 개의 거울이 연결되기를 원한다면, 거울 근처에 서 있거나 이 현상에 반응하는 다른 장치가 필요할 것입니다.<BR>나른 노드들처럼 입출력을 거울에 연결하기 위해 임페투스 공명장치를 사용할 수 있습니다. 각 거울에는 사용 가능한 단일 입출력이 있습니다. 이는 거울 간의 고유한 양방향 임페투스 연결과는 별개입니다.<BR>거울이 제공하는 유연성에 대해 전반적으로 매우 만족하지만, 몇 가지 한계가 있습니다. 공허에서 분해되는 것을 방지하기 위해 임페투스 전달 속도를 제한해야 했으므로 처리량이 높은 전송이 필요한 경우 좀 더 현명해야 할 필요가 있습니다. 또한 이 거울은 다른 유형의 거울과 마찬가지로 오라에도 동일한 압박을 가하기 때문에 거울을 사용하여 임페투스를 전달하면 두 거울 모두에서 플럭스가 발생합니다. 마지막으로, 거울은 임페투스 중계기와 같이 비교적 단순한 것에 비해 제작 비용이 훨씬 더 많이 들기 때문에, 사용을 최소화하기 위해 임페투스 구조를 지능적으로 설계하도록 노력해야 합니다.

thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_management.title=균열 관리
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_management.0=As my usage of flux rifts increases, the rifts themselves seem to be fighting back. Not unexpected for a volatile tear in the fabric of magic, but I need to find ways to better manage them. An unstable rift is incredibly dangerous, prone to destroying whatever is around it.<BR>Before I begin investigating means of managing rifts, however, I shall first compile some notes on their behaviour I have noticed while working with them.<BR>Rifts form when too much flux appears in the local aura, around three-fourths of the total vis cap to be precise - a fact that I learned the hard way. If I am wearing Goggles of Revealing, I can faintly see the rift through the terrain, so if a rift appears in an unknown location I can use those to help locate it. The rift will continue to absorb the excess flux in the aura, growing in size as it does so. However, if there is no more flux to sustain the rift, it will become more and more unstable. There is also a point where even in the presence of flux, the rift cannot sustain its growth. This effectively sets a maximum size that rifts that naturally grow to.<BR>I have also observed some interesting characteristics about a rift's stability. A rift gains stability from absorbing flux, or, in its absence, by inducing an instability event to expunge some of its unstable energy. I can also stabilize a rift with the redstone-based stabilizers I created for use in infusion. Using a stabilizer like this does present a problem in that it generates more flux than a single rift consumes, but I suppose it will have to do until I devise a better method for stabilizing rifts.<BR>One way of identifying a rift's stability at a glance is through its movement. A perfectly stable rift will appear to be perfectly stationary, but as it loses stability it will begin pulsing and shifting. If the rift starts releasing small wisps of energy, it has reached the point where it will create chaotic disruptions at any moment. I believe that these wisps are the rift discharging its unstable energies, with this energy coming from the chaotic Void on the other side of the rift which is "shaped" by the rift into unpleasant flux-related chaos.<BR>Instability effects vary, but they are unpleasant and potentially lethal. One of the most common events is the rift condensing the flux into a physical form, namely through a taint seed. If the seed is not quickly removed, the area around it will become a flux-filled mess, potentially setting off a chain reaction of more rifts forming. Other events include the release of proper wisps, the ones that zap anything that comes too close, as well as clouds of flux forming in the vicinity. In rare circumstances, the rift may naturally collapse, sealing the breach in reality on its own. This is the same process that is induced by a causality collapser, but occurs so infrequently that it probably is not worth waiting for.<BR>Finally, I should note that a flux rift's connection to the Void means that it interacts with physical matter in destructive ways. Flux rifts are capable of consuming all but the most durable of materials if they grow into them, not even leaving an item behind. Living matter will similarly be quickly destroyed on contact.<BR>With these behaviours documented, I believe I am now prepared to design some tools to better manage these rifts. Despite how dangerous they are, I know that they are crucial to my continued attempts to unlock all of the secrets Thaumaturgy has to offer.

thaumicaugmentation.research.void_recharge_pedestal.title=공허 충전대
thaumicaugmentation.research.void_recharge_pedestal.0=Since I now have access to more handheld or portable items that use impetus in their operation, I should look into better methods to supply them with that impetus. Currently I can use the Impetus Diffuser to charge them up, but there are two major downsides to using it: firstly that the diffuser outputs only a very slow trickle of impetus into items, taking a long time to charge them up fully, and secondly it can only charge items that I am either holding out in my hand or that I have equipped on my person. These problems are the result of the diffuser outputting normal impetus in the area around it, so if I were to design a method of charging items up with a more direct beam of charged impetus then it would almost certainly limit these prior issues.<BR>At first I was a little lost about where to start with this task, but after some thinking I believe I can use my old Recharge Pedestal as a starting point. Vis and impetus have some interesting similarities, and the old notes I found referenced methods of using the long-forgotten node-drawn CV in order to charge thaumaturgy's ancient wands. With these two pieces of knowledge in mind, I believe I can create a new form of Recharge Pedestal that takes in a beam of charged impetus and rapidly charges any items placed on top of it.<BR>Hopefully I can create something good out of this, I'd rather not have to sit next to a diffuser for any longer than I have to, especially considering that even the faint trails of impetus make me somewhat... uneasy.
thaumicaugmentation.research.void_recharge_pedestal.1=The Void Recharge Pedestal is now ready to be built, and it should be far better for charging individual items with impetus than the diffuser I've only had access to up until now. I've taken the basic design of the standard Recharge Pedestal, replaced the standard magical components with more Void-related ones and tweaked the piece on top so it can better channel impetus energy.<BR>When built and placed in the world, I can prepare the new pedestal simply by directing a beam of charged impetus energy into it (using the Impetus Resonator as normal), and then once any empty or partially filled impetus using items are placed into the pedestal a beam of impetus energy will be fed into the item. The item should charge far, far more rapidly than with the diffuser, although I should make sure not to step into the active beam of impetus while I charge the item.

thaumicaugmentation.research.arcane_terraformer.title=아케인 테라포머
thaumicaugmentation.research.arcane_terraformer.0=For some time now, I have pondered the possibility of artificially manipulating the natural world around me in ways normally impossible. For instance, while it is possible for anyone with enough time, strength, and resourcefulness to manipulate the terrain around them to fit their needs, they cannot truly change the underlying biomes that the area exists within. I have desired to break this rule enforced upon the world by all of reality, but the magic I have had access to has not been enough to change this fact.<BR>At least, until now. My studies into the volatile and transmutative properties of impetus have now opened a door for me, one that leads to the possibility of true world-manipulating power. Even with this knowledge, changing the underlying biomes in the world will require a great deal of magical force and a certain level of ingenuity, given that I will need to permanently alter the aura around me to successfully terraform an area.<BR>To gain an insight into the momumentous task ahead of me, I will need to open my mind to the wider world around me and see the many sights and sounds it offers. This means exploring and visiting a few different biomes in the world, to see how reality fundamentally operates in them and observe the subtle changes in this operation between biomes.

thaumicaugmentation.research.arcane_terraformer.1=The true scale of the natural and supernatural world is still as unclear as ever, but despite that I have gained brief glimpses and flashes of understanding that have taught me how I can change it far more than I could before. In front of me I have a set of designs that detail a device that uses the combined power of the aura, the elements, and the Void to terraform the world around it, changing biomes precisely how I instruct it to. Appropriately, I have named this device the Arcane Terraformer.<BR>The Terraformer itself is all packed into a single contraption, but it requires a great deal of additional equipment and setup in order to function. I will cover the device in detail for my future reference; it is a very complex piece of arcane engineering, and it is far too easy for me to forget the specifics of its functionality.<BR>The first step to bending the world to my will is to configure the specific biome that the Arcane Terraformer will convert the area around it into. I have created a special Biome Focus to serve this purpose. To attune the focus to a biome, I simply need to visit the biome in question and use the Focus within it. This will store the intrinsic properties of the biome in the Focus, a sort of "fingerprint", which will later allow the Arcane Terraformer to perfectly replicate it. Sneaking while using the focus will clear its current biome, allowing it to be reused.<BR>I have already considered a potential dilemma I may face after terraforming: what if I want to restore the land to its original state? To save myself the headache of manually managing Biome Foci, I have found a way to allow the Terraformer to perfectly restore the original biome or biomes in its area of operation. I refer to this as the primeval state, as it is the way the land was originally formed. At least, original enough for my purposes. To create a primeval Biome Focus, I only need to place the Focus with a primordial pearl in a crafting grid. This does not consume any portion of the pearl, since the Focus only absorbs the pearl's ambient energy.<BR>The first step in actually using the Terraformer is to access its configuration panel by using the device after placing it in the world. At the center of the panel is where I place the configured Biome Focus, which gets affixed to the top of the device. On the right are the area settings, which allow me to specifiy both the size and shape of the terraforming area. The left side will display the amount of essentia I need to fully terraform the entire selected area, assuming I have a Biome Focus inserted into the Terraformer.<BR>I then need to ensure that the Arcane Terraformer has access to sufficient amounts of three resources: vis, essentia, and impetus. Vis is simple enough, as the Terraformer will simply draw a small amount of Vis from the area it is placed in for each square metre of the world it converts. Impetus is slightly more complicated, as I must connect a charged impetus input into the central jewel at the bottom of the device.<BR>The last ingredient is essentia, and a lot of it. There are five types of essentia that the Arcane Terraformer could potentially need to terraform the area. These are Ignis, Aqua, Aer, Terra, and Permutatio. The first four are the primal elemental aspects, and these will be required if they are a part of the biome that is to be terraformed into. Fiery or hot biomes will need ignis, damp biomes require aqua, and so on. Some biomes may not need a certain elemental aspect of essentia at all. However, every biome requires Permutatio in some capacity - this is what allows the Terraformer to actually exchange the biomes. The exact amount of essentia required increases with the amount of area that needs to be terraformed, which can be seen on the left side of the information panel as previously mentioned. This is probably one of the most essentia-hungry devices I have designed to date, since it requires so much to permanently change the physical world. If I plan on using this device frequently or over a large area, I should prepare plenty of essentia jars filled with the four elemental aspects and permutatio.<BR>With all of this setup done, I will be able to finally start the terraforming process by using a casting gauntlet on the Arcane Terraformer. If I need to cancel it for any reason, I can use a gauntlet on it a second time, although any terraforming that was already done will not revert.<BR>Despite the high resource cost the device needs to terraform an area, there is a major benefit I can gain from selecting certain biomes: I can increase the vis cap of the local aura. As part of the terraforming process, the Arcane Terraformer restabilizes the aura in any area it has terraformed. When transforming biomes with little vis to more magically attuned biomes, such as magical forests, the maximum vis that the area can hold will be dramatically increased. This can be especially helpful should my base of operations be located in an area with lower amounts of natural vis. However, the aura can also have its cap be lowered in this way, so I need to monitor the aura in areas I have terraformed, lest I unexpectedly run out of vis.

thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_feeder.title=균열 성장
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_feeder.0=Flux rifts can grow to some fairly large sizes simply by absorbing flux from the local aura, but they can only do so to a certain limit. At some point, it grows large enough where it cannot absorb flux efficiently enough to grow any further. This can present a problem in that if I am draining a rift for one reason or another, I need to constantly monitor its size to ensure I do not drain it out of existence. Furthermore, I would rather not have to repeatedly pollute the aura in order to keep the rift at a decent size, as the flux can spread to other areas and generally cause a mess.<BR>There has to be a better way to grow my flux rifts. After some thinking, I believe there might be a solution to this problem. In my previous efforts around flux management, I managed to create the Flux Condenser, which draws flux from the aura and condenses it into Vitium essentia. I do not see a reason why I would not be able to do the opposite.<BR>It is already technically possible to do such a thing, in that I can simply place a jar of essentia and empty it into the aura as flux, but this is not what I need. Instead, I will need to transfer the flux carefully by focusing it all into a specific point, which in this case would be a flux rift. I will need to be careful with my experimentation here, as flux has a habit of being very insidious in how it pollutes an area. The last thing I need is an infestation of taint eating away at my base of operations...
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_feeder.1=I can now breathe a sigh of relief, as I have managed to successfully avoid creating a major flux problem, at least with this particular batch of research. I'd rather not think about the problems I may have already caused. Ahem.<BR>Regardless, I have managed to reengineer my design for the Flux Condenser into a device I am calling the Flux Inducer. While its name might suggest that it creates flux in the area around it, this is not quite the truth, as the whole point of making this device is to avoid doing that. Rather, when pointed at a flux rift, the Inducer will be able to feed flux directly into it, causing the rift to grow. Because this directly inserts flux into the rift, instead of relying on it to absorb flux on its own, rifts should be able to grow far larger than they would normally be able to. My calculations suggest that they can grow twice as large as before, so I should ensure there is enough space for these massive rifts to grow without breaking vital equipment.<BR>However, nothing in this world ever seems to come without a price, and as such the Flux Inducer has some caveats to its operation. First and foremost, it needs Vitium essentia in order to grow a rift. It can be fed into any side of the device except its front, via the usual piping mechanisms. It can require a lot of Vitium to grow the rift, and the amount required gradually increases as the rift's size increases, so a steady supply of Vitium is a must. The original Flux Condenser would probably pair very well with the Flux Inducer for this purpose.<BR>Secondly, I need to ensure the device is placed facing the rift, as the front of the device contains the rift feeding mechanism. I can place the device facing me by simply placing it as normal, but if I sneak while placing it the Flux Inducer will be facing away from me. I will also need to ensure that the Inducer is kept within about 12 metres of the rift, and the rift is placed in view of the Inducer. I will know when the device is in range when faint, flux-colored particles are being pulled from the Flux Inducer by the rift. This does not actually consume any Vitium essentia, nor does it affect the state of the rift in any discernable way.<BR>Thirdly, an important point to mention is that feeding a rift in this way will cause it to grow unstable. This is probably a side effect of inserting the flux into the rift, rather than letting the rift absorb flux at its own pace. I may wish to use one of the methods of stabilizing rifts I have researched, keeping in mind any byproducts (like flux) they produce.<BR>Finally, I can deactivate the Flux Inducer with a redstone signal. If the front nozzle of the Inducer is a bright purple, then it is active.

thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_generator.title=임페투스 발전기
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_generator.0=Mundane electrical energy is something I have already managed to generate through thaumaturgic means, despite how the two disciplines tend to work against each other. But while the Vis Generator is quite effective, it is still limited in how much RF/FE it can output, due to the fact that the linking mechanism limits the conversion rate, and trying to go beyond this limit would most likely result in the magical and mundane energies making contact, creating all manner of havoc.<BR>However, I need not be limited by vis anymore, as my recent discovery of charged impetus provides me with an alternative method of generating kinetic energy which can then be used to power an electrical generator. From some cursory investigation, impetus interacts with mundane power differently than vis does. Its unpredictable and volatile nature ironically means that it isn't so strongly affected by it, as it can adapt itself to become resistant to mundane power's negative influence, so I should be able to use it to generate electricity faster than I can with vis.<BR>This new generator shouldn't be too hard to prototype since I already have the framework designed with the Vis Generator. If I swap out the appropriate vis and aura-related components with Void and impetus-centric ones, and modify the underlying linkages and energy containment systems to account for the more unpredictable forces of the Void, I should be able to feed these into the same axle and electrical generator that I used for the Vis Generator.
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_generator.1=After some further study of impetus power and reworking of the designs for the Vis Generator, I now have access to a new RF/FE generating device which uses the powers of the Void in its operation as opposed to the vis I have been using previously. It takes a few more advanced components to create and requires charged impetus in order to run, but it can generate electrical power at a far better rate than the Vis Generator.<BR>Once built, the Impetus Generator is used in a very similar way to the Vis Generator. Firstly, it must be directly attached to an appropriate redstone flux or forge energy using, transferring, or storing block. Secondly, a beam of charged impetus energy must be linked into it using the Impetus Resonator to do so. Then, once the Impetus Generator receives charged impetus power, it will generate 1500 RF/FE for a small amount of impetus, of which it can output 50 RF/FE per tick. The output speed, while still limited, is much better than the Vis Generator's, so if I have any magical devices that need mundane energy to run (or if I am dabbling in the use of mundane technology and feel like using more esoteric means of generating power) then this can act as an excellent source of it.<BR>As with most of my devices, the generator can be turned off with a redstone signal.

thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_moving.title=균열 재배치
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_moving.0=The fabric of reality does seem to be a very fickle thing, and one may find evidence for this in how flux rifts appear.<BR>When an area gains too much flux, a rift appears, this is well documented. However, where the rift appears is an inexact science. They generally appear on the surface, or at the highest point where there is solid ground. But even with that in mind, where they precisely appear is almost impossible to predict. I would rather not have to work around this behaviour, instead, I would prefer to have the option to move the rift to wherever I choose.<BR>Moving something that extends into higher dimensions will not be an easy feat to undertake, however. While I could hypothetically 'drag' the rift to a particular spot, I imagine this could have some particularly destructive effects on the fabric of reality, so I will have to be a little more creative in how I move them.<BR>Warded jars are specially designed to contain dangerous substances, primarily essentia. However, with some additional modifications I might be able to have them hold a small pocket of space within them, that space including a rift breaking through it. This would therefore prevent any negative effects that simply moving the rift around would have, since it would all be contained safely within the jar.<BR>While this is all good in theory, I still haven't found a way to actually do this, and I haven't thought of a way to get a rift into a jar in the first place. One might think this is a major setback and that it might as well be impossible, but as a Thaumaturge I do the impossible on a regular basis. Magic is a very powerful thing, after all.
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_moving.1=I have spent a great deal of effort further analyzing the dimensional magic that flux rifts are a product of, and as a result of that effort I have now designed a method for moving them from one place to another. The process requires some very specialized equipment, which is unsurprising given what I am working with.<BR>There are a total of three things I will need to move a rift from one place to another: a special type of warded jar to contain the rift; a device that can pull the rift inside itself and place it within the jar; and a device that can take the rift out of the jar and project it back out into the world. I shall cover each one in turn.<BR>Firstly, the jar. I have designed this jar to be far sturdier than a normal jar, in order to contain a volatile rift and the space in which it inhabits. To that end, it contains additional protective glyphs, an additional warding sigil and a set of sturdy magically resistant metal braces, all to prevent the rift from breaking loose. It cannot be used to store essentia anymore, but this hardly matters since it wouldn't have any particular benefit for that purpose over an ordinary warded jar.<BR>Secondly, the device that places the rift into a jar, which I am calling the Metaspatial Accumulator. It is a complex device able to carefully manipulate space in dimensions beyond the ordinary three, so it would be wise to make sure that I do not lose it once I have it. To use it, I only need to place it beneath a flux rift (making sure that the rift does not destroy it in the process), place a reinforced jar directly below the device (if I can see the device connected to the jar then I have set it up correctly), and then to actually store the rift in the jar I use the Accumulator with a caster's gauntlet.<BR>This jarring process can take some time depending on how big the rift is, and as it is being jarred the rift will lose stability, but if the process is successful then the rift will vanish and be placed within the jar. It would be wise to stand back when the rift vanishes though, as when a rift closes or collapses it creates a sudden shift in reality that is quite unpleasant to the psyche of nearby people who experience it (and I'd rather not think too hard about the damage already done to my mind).<BR>However, the jarring process can fail in a few different ways. Firstly, if the rift is so unstable that it tries to collapse, then the rift will 'snap back' to its original size and become extremely unstable, stopping the Accumulator in the process. It will fail in a similar way if I deliberately try to collapse the rift with a causality collapser. In some cases, instead of "snapping back" to its full size, it will instead release a large amount of flux. This seems to occur when the rift would disappear in a manner other than collapsing, such as when a taint seed is produced. The Metaspatial Accumulator will also fail if it or the Reinforced jar is broken. I should also note that if there is still a lot of flux in the area when the rift is successfully jarred, then another rift may appear immediately afterward, so I should be prepared for that.<BR>Thirdly, getting the rift out of the jar. To do that, I will need a third device I have named the Metaspatial Extruder. The unjarring process is very similar to the jarring one, so I must first place the Extruder down, and place a jarred rift directly underneath it. If I am wearing Goggles of Revealing, I can see an estimation of where the rift will be placed above the device. To begin, I simply need to use a caster's gauntlet on the device. The rift will then gradually begin to appear above the device, and if the process is successful then the rift will fully form, emptying the connected jar. If the Extruder tries to place the rift close to a rift that is already present, then the device will not start the process as a safety measure, as that could get very dangerous. If the process is interrupted by the rift collapsing or the device/jar being broken, then the rift will dissipate entirely, leaving nothing more than a large cloud of flux behind, which might form a new rift in the process.<BR>There are risks involved with all of this, there is no doubt, but I cannot turn back now, and if the worst that can happen with either machine is that another flux rift is created, then so be it. After all, I can just use that flux rift instead.<BR>Finally, of note is that I can keep rifts inside reinforced jars indefinitely, so they can work well for decorative purposes, since they are safe if not disturbed. The rift will break free chaotically if the jar is destroyed in something like lava or fire however, which will create a lot of flux, cause the rift to become very unstable while also destroying the jar completely, so if I want to get the rift out then using the Metaspatial Extruder is the better thing to do. I am unsure what will happen if I try to destroy a jarred rift in a more unique way, such as with purely technological systems designed to store and catalogue items, so I should be prepared for the worst if I decide to study disciplines outside of Thaumaturgy and use them to destroy a jarred rift.<BR>Interestingly, a jarred rift can even be used as a means of item destruction in itself. If a device such as a hopper or golem is used to place items in it, then those items will be completely destroyed. The rift will become a little unstable as it does so, but since it is contained it will regain its stability soon after. This does leave me with a dark thought, however: what if I were to jar two rifts, and then try and destroy one jarred rift by placing it in the other, or if I were to throw one jarred rift into a rift present in the world? If I am not fully prepared to find out the answer to this conundrum, then playing it safe may be for the best...

thaumicaugmentation.research.stability_field_generator.title=고급 안정화 방법
thaumicaugmentation.research.stability_field_generator.0=Dangerous magic is often naturally unstable, as chaotic magical energies are created that need to be released in one form or another, this form generally being very unpleasant for any Thaumaturge who happens to be nearby. Thus, on behalf of all Thaumaturges, I have decided to find a better way to deal with unstable magic, in this case unstable magic made by flux rifts.<BR>I have already designed a device that can stabilize flux rifts, the stabilizer, but as it was originally designed to stabilize arcane infusions it is not very effective at dealing with the more distributed form of instability that a rift creates. It works very slowly if I am only using a few, I cannot turn it off when I need to, and it creates a lot of flux that can actually make a flux rift grow even worse. It is a little bit like using a bucket of lava to put out a house fire: yes, the lava may smother some of the flames, but the lava itself is creating even more fire which spreads everywhere, and suddenly I am left without a house, the house being analogous for a stable aura I suppose.<BR>Regardless, I know I can do better than this. The Stabilizer's ability to stabilize flux rifts is only a side effect created by how it works, so if I instead try to create a stabilizing device designed to work on flux rifts specifically, then I should be much more successful than before.<BR>Previously, I used a limited amount of mundane technology in the form of a redstone block to stabilize infusions, so I am now wondering if I can use mundane technology in a slightly more advanced fashion to get a better result. I have already managed to generate mundane electrical power in the form of RF/FE with the vis generator, so perhaps I should try to study ordinary electricity a little further? Simply bombarding a flux rift with electricity won't work, however, so I'll need to be intelligent with how I apply it.
thaumicaugmentation.research.stability_field_generator.1=Mundane technology has once again provided me with the answer to my stability problems. Previously I had trouble properly understanding the links between electrical power and magical power, but after some careful study I now understand a little better how the two may interact with one another. Generally this means rather poorly, but if I am careful I should be able to use one to neutralize or otherwise restrict the other. In this case, I can use electricity in the form of redstone flux or forge energy to quell unstable rift energies.<BR>To facilitate this interaction, I have taken my design for the infusion stabilizer and heavily reworked it, so much so that my new design only vaguely resembles the old one. I am calling this new design the Stability Field Generator. It uses a few different magical and technological principles in order to operate. By taking RF or FE, sending it through some additional redstone circuits and stabilizing runes and then discharging it through an amber tip, it fires a beam which creates a containment field of sorts. The amber is a key component here; by applying sympathetic magic, I can use it to 'trap' a flux rift in a field of stabilizing energy, which will cause it to rapidly regain stability without the flux problem that a normal stabilizer creates.<BR>To use the device, I first need to point it so that its tip faces a flux rift. Then, I need to feed in mundane RF/FE into any side of the device except its front, since the front is where the field is emitted from. I may want to use vis generators for this, as they are very compact and can feed their power directly into a port on the Stability Field Generator. Once it receives power, the front of the device will open, and it will fire the stability field directly at the rift. It uses 100 RF/FE every second while active, which is not exactly cheap, but I have built the device so that it can be turned off by applying a redstone signal to it. The more Stability Field Generators I use on a rift, the faster it will regain stability.<BR>One major drawback that the device has is that when it is left on for extended periods of time, the stabilizing field will gradually begin to lose effectiveness as the internal mechanics begin to overheat. However, if the device is turned off, it will cool down over a period of time and eventually fully recover. I can tell how overheated a Stability Field Generator is based on two visual cues. The first is the transparency of the beam it produces, with a less opaque beam being less efficient. The other sign is the presence of electricity discharging across it, visible as red electrical arcs on and around the device. Given that it will consume the same amount of energy but mitigate much less instability while overheated, it would be wise to make sure that I turn off any Stability Field Generators when I do not need them. Hypothetically speaking, it should be reasonable for me to automate such a process.<BR>While I can readily use my Thaumaturgy-specific means of generating electricity for the device to use, it will accept power from anywhere else as long as that power is in the form of RF or FE. Thus, if I have access to more advanced technological systems that can generate that form of electricity, or even alternate magical disciplines that interact with mundane energy, then I can use any power generators provided by them in order to power the stability field.<BR>I should note that since this device is designed to work on the more distributed form of instability that a flux rift creates, it will not be able to stabilize infusions. A pity, but it would be difficult to redesign the device a second time to work like that, and I already have the infusion stabilizer for that purpose anyway.

thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_monitor.title=차원의 영향 감시
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_monitor.0=While I can learn a fair amount about a flux rift just by simple observation, I can only understand so much with the naked eye alone. I need a better way to study them, which I believe will require a new, specialized device.<BR>Previously I have created the Thaumic Dioptra, which uses a Thaumometer to analyze the aura in a wide radius before displaying the strengths of vis and flux as a heightmap. I believe I can rework this design, but instead make the Thaumometer at its core receptive to the energies produced by flux rifts. I could use the readings created by this device for a few different purposes, so I am sure the final product will be well worth the research.<BR>I simply must try to learn more about extra-dimensional phenomenon. Despite the risks involved, it is all so very fascinating...
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_monitor.1=Interesting... so very interesting... this has all been something of a learning exercise, and I now know quite a bit more about flux rifts than I did before. This knowledge will be absolutely invaluable for my future studies into dimensional magic, in fact these studies have already borne fruit in a new device I have designed, which I am calling the Extradimensional Monitor.<BR>The device contains a heavily modified Thaumometer at its core, with specially selected runes designed to make it sensitive to the energies produced by phenomena that breach into higher dimensional space. There are quite a few things that create these energies, however, so I have made sure that it only responds to the particular signature that a flux rift creates, otherwise things like Nether or End portals could interfere with the device and produce false readings.<BR>Once placed down, the Monitor scans the local area and once it picks up something it recognizes, it will begin collecting data about it, projecting that data on the display above. In the case of flux rifts, the device will display a hologram of the rift it is monitoring. It has a fairly large radius in which it can pick up rifts, but I should note that if a monitor is placed down and the rift changes size, this may cause the rift to go outside the range of the monitor and therefore it will lose track of it, so if I am monitoring a rift that changes size frequently then I should try to keep the monitor fairly close by.<BR>The device has two modes that I can switch between by right-clicking the device, these modes being for size and stability. Size mode analyses how large a flux rift is. The grid below has a pair of markers that show how tall a two block stack is in comparison to the size of the flux rift, so I can use that to tell roughly how big the rift is compared to myself. Stability mode is designed to monitor the rift's stability, unsurprisingly. The view is pulled in closer to a cross-section of the rift hologram, and from there I can observe how much the rift is shaking to better see how unstable it is. As I have noted before, a perfectly stable rift will be perfectly still, and a very unstable one will thrash about violently.<BR>Another feature the device has, one that may prove to be particularly useful, is its ability to create a redstone signal. By connecting a redstone comparator to the side of the monitor, the comparator will output a redstone signal that correlates to the current size or stability of the rift it is analyzing, depending on what mode the monitor is set to. For instance, if the monitor is set to size mode, then the comparator signal will become stronger the larger the rift is, and if it is set to stability mode, the comparator signal will get stronger the more stable the rift is. I can see potential future use in automatic rift management systems with this feature, like ensuring that a void siphon draining the rift is turned off if the rift gets too small or unstable.<BR>As the dimensional fractures I have discovered are a naturally appearing variant of flux rifts that create a bridge across dimensions, the Extradimensional Monitor can very easily be tuned to analyze them. As with flux rifts, the device has two modes for fracture reading.<BR>Mode one reads the fracture and shows some details about where it leads to. A 7 by 7 grid is displayed beneath the fracture, with this showing the ambient colours of the biome that it leads to. The potential grass colour of the biome is displayed in the 3x3 centre of the grid, the potential foliage colour is displayed in the hollow 5x5 grid around that, and the water colour is displayed in the hollow 7x7 grid around that. This is somewhat limited, but I can gain some insight about the destination, with greener colours of grass and foliage leading to more lush areas, yellower colours of grass leading to arid areas like deserts, darker coloured water likely leading to swamp-like areas, so on and so forth. Different dimensions are also indicated this way, so to better differentiate them from biomes in the Overworld.<BR>Mode two pulls the view in closer to the fracture, but unlike with rifts it does not monitor stability, since fractures do not get unstable. Instead, it just provides a closer look, which I can use to see if the fracture is open or closed.<BR>I am learning so much about dimensional tears as of late, and I can sense such potential lurking here. For now, I can only imagine what I might be able to create with all of this knowledge in the future.

thaumicaugmentation.research.vis_battery_augment.title=건틀렛 비스 저장소
thaumicaugmentation.research.vis_battery_augment.0=I have made great strides in the efficacy of my casting, allowing me access to more powerful, rapid, or efficient spellcasting. Even with all of these improvements, however, there is still one major issue with relying on foci: in the absence of a suitably strong Aura, I am left being unable to use any of my focus effects, no matter how much gauntlet augmentation I have done.<BR>That being said, repurposing my older creations has been the solution to many Thaumaturgical problems, and I believe this is no exception. Vis Batteries do almost exactly what I need; they absorb Vis when it is plentiful, and release it if the Aura is depleted. The only challenge will be somehow limiting the Vis Batteries to only potentially release vis when casting, but I have always found ways around these dilemmas in the past, and do not intend to let this break that trend.
thaumicaugmentation.research.vis_battery_augment.1=Although it does not feel like it, I have made another great stride in my studies of Auromancy. My invention of portable Vis Batteries in augment form has eliminated one of its major weaknesses.<BR>The Vis Battery augment works similarly to a normal Vis Battery. It can only charge itself with Vis by direct exposure to the Aura, not through any other method. It will also only take in Vis when the Aura is at least 90% saturated with vis. Unlike Vis Batteries, the augment will not automatically discharge when in a weak Aura. Instead, it will discharge Vis if the focus I am attempting to cast requires more Vis than is available in the Aura. This means I cannot use it as a true portable Vis battery, as I cannot arbitrarily decide to release the stored Vis into the Aura, but this was never the goal to begin with.<BR>While I have successfully linked four Vis Batteries in series in the final augment, the total vis capacity is still somewhat low. I may want to combine this augment with others that reduce the total casting cost if I frequently find myself drawing from the very limited pool of stored vis.
